Vive,DETAILED GUIDE: Half-Life 2 Campaign in VR (via Garry's Mod),"**Introduction:** 

* Recently I played through Lambda1VR (HL1) on Quest, and loved it. As soon as I finished, I wanted to continue in to HL2. This was the best method I found, and I’m happy to say that I **loved** it! It was a fantastic, epic experience, even with all the technical and configuration challenges. 
* Would highly recommend it to any serious fans. Turns out the gravity gun is pretty fun in VR – who knew. 
* I probably spent about 12-15 hours in the campaign, and another 5 or so hours messing around with stuff to get it working. 
* This guide is intended to reduce the time you spend messing around, so that you can get more time in the game and complete Half-Life 2 completely in Virtual Reality. 

**Requirements:** 

* Garry’s Mod + HL2 in Steam – Garry’s Mod was a cheap $12 for me, though I have no interest in it other than for this application. 
* VR Legs / Iron Stomach – I don’t ever feel sick, but there are some moments here that will **test you**. The airboat is the biggest offender by far, but I think there may have been a few other moments that I can’t specifically recall – **be cautious if you are prone to sickness, and consider leaving this for when your VR legs improve.**
* Patience – The game plays through from start to finish more or less perfectly, but this is an enthusiast/diehard experience and completely unfit for people who aren’t willing to roll their sleeves up. 

**How to Install / Play:**

1. Make sure you have Half-Life 2 and Garry’s Mod installed on Steam.
2. Navigate to the Workshop for Garry’s Mod and install “VRMod - Experimental Virtual Reality” and “Half-Life 2 Campaign Content” mods. (note: I’m not sure if the campaign content mod is strictly necessary).
3. Enable DSR Super-Sampling through your [NVIDIA Control Panel 3d Settings](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/dynamic-super-resolution-instantly-improves-your-games-with-4k-quality-graphics/) (DSR Factors – might as well click ‘em all as far as I can tell – this allows supersampling)
4. Launch Steam VR.
5. Launch Garry’s Mod (you will get a warning, disregard)
6. Increase the resolution in the Garry’s Mod Video menu. SteamVR resolution settings do not work – you must change them manually (how high you go depends on your video card. On a 1080Ti, I used 3325 horizontal.)
7. Start a new game and select HL2 from the options. 
8. If you are starting for the first time, choose d1\_trainstation\_01 – they are NOT in correct order, rather they are alphabetical. If you want pick up where you’ve left off, you can find the correct map order [**here**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Vive/Point%20Insertion)**.** (Note: it can be difficult to make out the text at very high resolutions, so you might want to get a feel for where your map is prior to increasing resolution). 
9. Choose start game. You will spawn with all the appropriate weapons for that map in the game, typically with a full clip and one extra per weapon. 
10. To activate VR, hold down **“Q”** on the keyboard – this will open the Garry’s Mod VR in-game menu. Navigate to the **“utilities”** section, and the “**VRMod”** entry will be at the bottom of the list. 
11. Make sure you check “Automatically load VR when you start a new map” (towards the bottom) so that you can skip this step in future sessions. You can also select HMD/Controller oriented movement, as well as a few others. Avoid the ‘world models’ for wepaons, they don’t work right. 
12. Click “Start VR” and enjoy Half-Life 2. 

I used the following [youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjmN9wt7h5Q&amp;feature=emb_title) to get myself started, so props to them and please consider viewing it if you are having trouble with any of the above steps. 

**There is NO Saving, so what happens when I die/quit?** 

if you die, you have two or three options, depending. 

1. **Restart:** If you really care about not cheating, the best bet is usually to fully exit gmod and restart at the beginning of whichever map you died on. Each map is relatively short, and this isn’t a significant problem. Just be cautious, take things slowly/seriously and you’ll be fine. You will lose your ammo as a penalty for death, but you are given enough at the start of the map to be able to make it comfortably. This can be a pain, but reloading the map without restarting often seems to break things (or did for me). 
2. **Respawn:** You can also respawn, but you will respawn in that same instance - with all the NPCs who were dead, still dead, etc. If a door opened in the beginning of the map, but is now closed, you might be barred from going through. You can noclip through and usually be fine though. If you want to emulate 'checkpoint saving' and dont care too much about the purity of your run, this is probably the simplest option to advance in the game. You will spawn without weapons, and so either need to pick them up in the map, or give them to yourself through the “Q” menu in Garry’s Mod. 
3. **Kill Key NPC:** Finally, if you happen to be accompanied by an important NPC, their death will be game over. When you respawn, this will be a clean level load for some reason and everything will work. So if something glitches and you want to start fresh, just kill Barney or Alyx with a combine ball, which is the most effective immediate KO. 

**Setting Up Controls:**

* Many of the default controls assume you are playing Garry’s Mod, and so the mapping can be improved. I used Vive Wands, and used this  [layout](https://imgur.com/a/BEPMzpH) , you can download my [SteamVR Input export](http://s000.tinyupload.com/index.php?file_id=23776465543963730812). It was also saved in the community bindings, but I have not been able to access those recently. Further note, I think my controls could be further improved for sure, so if anyone works on a better default, I will post theirs here. 
* If you’re using other controllers, my export isn’t working for you, and you’re not already familiar with SteamVR Input mapping, this is a good time to get your feet wet. You can basically rebind everything to your liking. 
* One input that is valuable for troubleshooting is the Garry’s Mod “Q” Menu. This is a menu that you want occasionally, but don’t need quick access to. I created a chord (left menu, left grip) to open this menu in the Steam Input Settings. 

**Control Tips:**

* **Using objects:** To “use” something, the 'action point' that determines whether you can activate something is at the end of the right hand - but not just the hand, its the model. If you have the empty hands/crowbar etc, the action point becomes the centre of your HMD. 
* **Flashlight:** Your flashlight will come out of your right hand as well. You will notice *significant* performance drops when the flashlight is on in some environments. I’m sure this can be tweaked or modified in the video settings. 
* **Aiming Melee/Grenades**: To aim crowbars and grenades, use your HMD - not your right hand. Don’t know why this is the case, but it is. The centre of the flashlight can help you to aim the crowbar. 
* **Aiming Guns:** For some guns, the iron sights are somewhat workable (i.e. pistol), on others (i.e. SMG) they’re not reliable. The combine gun doesn’t even have sights! Consider this a flavor-win…if you just picked up an alien gun, maybe it wouldn’t be setup with your ease of use in mind. That said, I found a consistent way to sight even the combine gun, and I’m sure you can too!
* **Who you talkin’ to?:** You may notice some of the NPC’s staring at the floor when they talk to you – that’s because they are talking to the end of your gun/right hand. You can solve this by either switching to empty hands/crowbar etc, or holding your gun’s barrel to your own face – or, as many of the game’s quirks, by ignoring and accepting this defect. 
* **Weapon Wheel:** If you're not familiar with the weapon wheel, it works by scrolling clockwise or counterclockwise to advance. It's not the best for large inventories, but honestly by the end I didn’t mind it. 
* **Ladders:** OK, so ladders seem crazy and almost made me tear my hair out – but actually, they work fine. also ladders are crazy. you will think they are incredibly broken and janky, but heres the process: you walk up and get your right hand in the proper distance to activate (if the activation point goes through the ladder, it wont work. Usually you can be pretty far from things, so err on the side of being farther away. AFTER YOU ACTIVATE THE LADDER, put both your hands in the air above your head.  You probably only need one of them, probbaly the right hand, or it might even be controller orientation,  but I always put my hands up and it worked everytime. To get off the ladder, 'use' it again. you'll almost always pop on to whatever surface you need to. 
* **Vehicles:** The Vehicles use their own separate bindings, and for the most part they work fine – but keep in mind, the mounted weapons are completely, irreparably broken. Do not bother trying to fix them, you can’t. The mounted weapon seems to have a fixed relative orientation. I.e. it’s relative to the world, not to you or your controllers. Also like three different inputs have an influence in the way they aim. I actually managed to defeat the helicopter in the airboat despite this, but It basically meant that you always had to attack from the same direction – hard to explain, but the long-story short is: forget about them and don’t waste two hours of your life like I did. 
* **Q Menu:** The “Q” Menu in Garry’s Mod allows you to give yourself weapons, change settings in the VRmod, and spawn items/objects. This can occasionally be useful to get around glitchy areas, give yourself a weapon after respawning, or others. 

**Places you** ***will*** **get stuck (spoilers):** 

There are several sections that are outright broken and require workarounds, but luckily I have already figured them all out for you. Here they are in order of appearance:

* **The Water Trap:** During the d1\_canals\_01a you will be going through a long tunnel when you will find a pool of water. It can be difficult to get out of this and continue on. I would guess that most people who brave this mod and quit, quit here. I spawned some extra boxes and pallets, and then used those to help me jump up. I think that if you ‘raise your arms’ above your head while you try to get out, it might work for the same reason it works on ladders. Last resort, open the console and ‘noclip’ to get up. 
* **Vehicle Combat:** The gun doesn’t reliably work on the airboat or the car. During **Route Kanal** you will need to destroy an attack helicopter. Just spawn yourself an RPG with the “Q” Menu. It is possible to kill it with the gun (I did it) but in retrospect I wish I had just cheated my way through. You never need the gun on the buggy, so just ignore it. 
* **Ravenholm:** d1\_town\_03 is actually several maps and I believe is the only instance in which you will ‘load’ into the same map, and not the next one. This confused me the first time. This makes it annoying as you have to do all the sections in one go (or else clip/cheat through). If you do decide to respawn/cheat through to get to your old position, you will have to trigger all the scenes with the old man who helps you, as the level will not progress if the scenes have not triggered. 
* **Alyx in City 17:** The map d3\_citadel\_6b, where you meet back up with Alyx, has messed up spawns. If you load in from the previous level, and don’t die during this chapter, then you won’t even notice. But if you start directly from this map, or if you try to respawn in any way, you will definitely notice. It seems to be spawning randomly (multiplayer spawns???) and you will have to noclip back to the very beginning of the level, and then proceed normally to trigger the cutscene with Alyx and continue from there. 
* **Super Gravity Gun:** When you load into d3\_citadel\_03, you will be stripped of your weapons but you will not receive the super gravity gun. You need to download an addon to get it then give it to yourself in the “Q” menu.  You might find that your aim is now attached to your HMD – this is because the gun will take its Aim orientation from whichever weapon you had last (i.e. HMD if crowbar/hands/grenades, Right hand if gun). So if you switch to it from the machine gun (should be able to find one on the first combines or in Q menu) it will go back to normal. You will also find that your gun model might now be screwed up – no fix for this that I’m aware of, but it won’t impact gameplay. I don’t recommend installing this addon until later, as it will clutter up your menu and can screw up gun models when it’s not necessary. 
* **Episode 1 / Episode 2:** They just don’t work. Sorry. I ended up playing them flat. Was disappointing! If anyone does know how to get them working for a full playthrough, please let me know!!!

Apologies if there are any errors (which I'm sure there are at least a couple). I will update to incorporate corrections/suggestions/better tips/etc as they come in from the comments.

&amp;#x200B;

In the meantime, for all the brave souls who choose to take on the Combine in City 17 - good luck",1575926331.0,148,21,129422

Vive,Highly recommend Onward for anyone who plays Pavlov and Contractors,"Just a headsup because I know a lot of people who play VR shooters don't play more than 1-2 games regularly, and I think a lot of people would like this. 

Onward, for those who don't know, is the most realistic shooter in VR and one of the big three (Pavlov, Onward, Contractors). The Devs are very intent on it being a realistic MilSim so you're not going to get TTT or anything too comical (although it does have RPGs, Drones, C4, and stun guns). But it also means the game's tension, gunplay, and personal physics are unmatched. The primary mode is based on search and destroy so you don't respawn, and the game is all about positioning, directional audio, and flanking. There are more guns and attachments and there are dedicated classes, and sniper mechanics are better with both aim and scope smoothing that reduces tracking and hand jitter without making the game too easy. There are side sights and hybrid scopes, and the game makes you balance your loadout points between different attachments, body armor, grenades, or pistols.

You can definitely play both this and Pavlov or Contractors, but if you play Pavlov and prefer playing pure combat modes like Search and Destroy then Onward is perfect for you. I played over 200 hours of Pavlov but Onward just feels a lot better for pure combat modes and no weapons feel OP or terrible. Maps are huge and spotting enemies and figuring out their spawn is a big part of it, which also makes sniper rifles really viable. When you compare just combat and gunplay Onward feels like Pavlov 2.0, even if it is less forgiving. I also do a lot more crouching and evading in this.

Onward has modded maps (no rules or mode mods), although because it was sold on the Oculus store as well they don't use steam workshop. This means mods are little bit of a pain to download right now but the game doesn't lean on mods as much as pavlov. Onward also has other modes like Gun Game, One in the Chamber, and Spec Ops, but those are only available in private lobbies if they aren't the ""social mode"" of the month. It also has higher hardware requirements but the graphics look better in my view, and things like lighting and shadows look better with very little text when you're in combat that distracts you by becoming pixelated at a distance. It has a single player/co op mode where you hunt or escape AI who are really hard, maybe too hard.

It gets updated a fair amount, new custom maps come out steadily, etc. A quest version is reportedly on the way but I have no idea how that will be. There is a dedicated community and around ten lobbies even after midnight, with a lot of Pacific and European players, and a recent sale boosted player numbers a lot.",1575888262.0,93,107,129422
Vive,Vive FOV Values: For Unity Shader (s),"Heya brothers and sisters! First time poster, long time lurker.

While working on a shader I needed the horizontal and vertical FOV values; the search lead me here.
I found a thread where people were looking for the same, but there was no answer, so I dug into Unity and found the internal values.

Horizonal FOV: 106.0971
Vertical FOV: 111.7577

I wanted to post the answer to the old thread, but it was archived so I couldn't necro it, hence this post. Hope this helps someone over the days and years.

Vive,Gorillaz Inspired VR Experience in Development - Help Us Bring it to Life!,"Hi, I'm Jake. I'm a VR developer from Sydney, Australia. Earlier this year I released my first music VR project INTERSTELLA VR - A Daft Punk inspired experience. Watch the video or download it here: [jakedonaldsonvr.com/interstellavr](http://jakedonaldsonvr.com/interstellavr).

It created waves on the internet and received a lot of media attention, including articles from [Road To VR](https://www.roadtovr.com/daft-punk-vr-one-more-time-fan/), [EDM.com](https://edm.com/news/daft-punk-vr), and [DJ Mag](https://djmag.com/news/daft-punk%E2%80%99s-%E2%80%98one-more-time%E2%80%99-has-been-turned-vr-rave-watch).

Next I'm looking to produce a no-budget **GORILLAZ** inspired VR project based on the music video for [FEEL GOOD INC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyHNuVaZJ-k). It will be an immersive, interactive experience to be played on 6DOF headsets, like Vive, Rift and (potentially) Quest.

***I'm looking to build a team of talented and/or passionate collaborators to help bring this experience to life!*** Here's a list of roles I'm looking to fill:

* 3D artists (Character artists, environment artists)
* 3D Animators
* Riggers
* 2D artists

Vive,VR Game Idea (Nowhere else to post?),"Hey, Recently I was quite bored. So I wrote up an entire VR game plot in 2 hours. Don't you just hate it when you write a game, I do. Anyway, my game ""idea"" is called Cube-ustry (Mashup of cube, and industry, corny I know.)

Quick run-down
You start in a white void, infront of you is a gray desk, and three cube shaped holes, (Each hole had a colored sticker next to it. Red, Green, and Blue.) behind you is a chute/dispenser that appears to stretch into infinity.

""Hello"" the narrator greets.

""Welcome to your workplace, please state your name out loud.""

*Player presumably says name*

""Just kidding, I don't actually care. Your Employee #002.""

*Fax machine like sound plays from behind you, as a red cube falls out*

""Please grab the RED Cube and place it into the RED slot.""

Two events will trigger base on different reactions

*If player puts the cube in the red slot* (String 1)

""Good Good, You got this.""

*Fax like sound plays again, a green cube falls out this time. You get prompted with the same message as before""

""Please grab the GREEN Cube and place it into the GREEN slot.""

*if player puts it in*

""Great! You've got the hang of things, i'm sure you can figure the next thing out.""

*Fax Sound plays, once again. And a blue cube falls out of the chute, and the narrator says nothing.*

That is the main story, here is an additional part. 


*If player doesn't do as asked, for any cube insertion*
(StringF)

""As I said, put the (cubenamewillvaluebasedonevent) cube in the (^) slot.""

*If ignored again*

""I am simply an automated response system, I have no problem repeating forever""

Message will just repeat from now on


*If player doesn't do as asked*
(String2)



Main story continues:

*If final cube is placed in, 'blue'*

""There you go. You've got this, im sure you don't need my help anymore. Good luck Employee #002!"" 

""Oh, and heres a little gift.""

*A opening becomes visible on the top of the board and an 4 digit counter, like the ones you see on a calculator or alarm clock pops out*

""The more you get right, the higher the counter goes to. Get one wrong, and you lose a point. You may get rewards for good preformance""

*A random colored cube spawns*

From now on, you just put cubes in and get higher scores, if you put one in you lose a point and the cube gets launched out of the slot.

(Any devs who are willing to attempt this game can add easter eggs at this point, like for example 1337 cubes might give you a computer or something. Just random stuff, you can honestly do whatever you want :)

(If you reach 9999 the counter should reset and the narrator should pop in a 
""Wow, thats alot of cubes! If you weren't a simulation I would have promoted you.""


ACT 2 (The accident)

Upon wandering too the back of console (the machine that you put cubes into) there's a red button with a glass case around it, this case only opens when you finish the tutorial, aka when he stops talking to you.

If the button gets pressed, the narrator will say:

""Oh no, you shouldn't have pressed that. Didn't I tell you not to press buttons? No? Oh, oops.""

*The chute dispenses a purple cube*

""Gah! Don't pick that up, leave it there. I'll fix this,  just give me a moment, DO NOT PUT IT IN THE SLOTS.""

*if player leaves it for like 10 seconds*

""There, I have re-routed the button controls. Press it again to remove the cube.""

If the player presses the button again, the cube will fade away with a pop and the random Random Red Green or Blue cubes will continue to spawn normally unless the button is pushed again.

*If button is pushed again the narrator will yell*

""Why did you press it again? I can't fix it now. Look what you've done now.""

*ACT 2 continues normally now*

If player puts the purple cube in any of the 3 slots, the counter will start to flick to random numbers and the white void you where in has now faded to a black.

""No, oh no. This isn't good at all, I better cut the simu-"" 

Narrator stops mid-sentence

""Nevermind, hey Employee #2 behind the console there should be a plug, would you pull it for me?""

*If player pulls it, all objects will disappear and you'll be left in a black void. But then the void turns back to white, and you are once again presented with the console, chute and the narrators welcome. (Plug doesn't show up untill red button is pressed.)

From then on the story will repeat, but address you as employee #003 instead of two. If you get to that point and reset the game again, it will go up a number, and so on. 

*If player doesn't pull the plug, the game will reset on its own, you'll be back in the white void with a fresh new console, but this time there is no narrator.*

-end, for now-

I know that wasn't much of a quick run down, more like 25% of the entire story. Basically you do different things for different endings, if this is added to steam each ending could be an achievement. If you lads think this is a good game idea I'll post a pastbin link with a more detailed story line including all the ending and somewhat thought of easter eggs, also this is heavily inspired by The Stanley Parable, if you didnt already notice.

Reference/Key for this mess: 

https://imgur.com/a/2PfdkFp - full album

I sent in a ticket because I ran out of options when trying to fix my base station with the blinking red light, got a swift caring response back walking me through some steps and clarifying some facts. Fast forward a few months as this sort of things stresses me, I finally get round to responding with the information required.

A few days later I'm given a tracking number and told to pack the base station and a controller (right side trackpad issue) and they'll ""take care of this"" for me. 
When there's a chance at getting money the customer service is nice and quick. [Picture 1](https://imgur.com/ORRpEqe) 

No later than the next day I've been asked to pay near £120 for the repairs, being told my base station is no longer under warranty when it is and my controller due to a scratch/white paint from my cupboard on the end of the circular sensor needing me to pay for the full body kit to be replaced. [Picture 2](https://imgur.com/99nY8oD) [Picture 3](https://imgur.com/LzGVpT1)

Wanting to take this one item at a time I ask about the base station because that was beyond confusing. I get an email completely making me relieved, right? [Picture 4](https://imgur.com/qaj7CRP)

No - I check the ticket numbers and its a conflicting statement. Ticket number ending in 82 is the controller, ending in 80 is the base station. Meaning they're repairiing the wrong device. [Picture 5](https://imgur.com/JhtBJNG) [Picture 6](https://imgur.com/g2ilDLs)

Now its near Christmas and I'm currently expecting to receive a controller in a week or so when it should be the base station as promised. I'm reaching out to them through email, trading standards &amp; twitter whilst communicating with others who have had a similar issue.

[Picture 7](https://imgur.com/gDyinmF) is just about the controller and how if I was to ask it would be rejected to waive the inspection fee and just return it to me.

Any help is appreciated!


EDIT: 09/12/2019

I'll include my email to them and the response I get from here on out, thanks @RustDragon for the fair point.

I've received [word](https://imgur.com/a/D4MVj0O) from Vive and it seems like good news regarding the base station, I'm assuming by 'fix this issue' it's an optimists dream that it's the controller they're fixing, so I'll need to work on getting it back as they've informed me they don't do partial repairs [here](https://imgur.com/a/9dueLvF)

TL;DR
HTC are refusing to give me my product that I paid for unless I give them more than half the repair fee just to receive it in the same condition as I sent it in.

My play space is literally the minimum size SteamVR will allow, however. I don’t need that much slack on the HMD side in order to move around, so it seems unlikely that I would get tangled.

Vive,Bring a real heavy bag in with Vive Pucks.,"My Family was playing BOXVR tonight (we also play thrill of the fight, with fun on the heavy bag and body dummy) and I was thinking if the **Vive puck** could be used not only to bring boxing gloves in but **what about an actual heavy bag**.

I think this could get away with just two pucks but would be further customized with four pucks (for gloves).

Thing to question first off, can a game be coded for this, it would need to be set up correctly in your space.  Pretty much specifically for the game but hey all Gym equipment, bags etc are anyhow.

• Could a heavy bag be brought in with a **Vive puck** on top and on the bottom back side with the base stations fixed to properly track and pucks secured, we know gloves can be brought in.

• Could the **coding account delivered bag weight as input options** to help with bag motion tracking?

• Could the bag while in game have a **visual overlay arcade point system** to score and maybe even rhythm (think top right and bottom right side \*Behind the bag has an affixed glow or flash indicator for a hook and circle indicators on the face of the bag for straights and jabs when called up).

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly, if this could be done it would be niche I know but **how awesome would it be to have something you could for the first time (as far as i know) actually feel a real life impact from while in VR and not a simulated impact**, really as far as I know it would be the first real world experience and actually could be done, right now!   Or does this seem far fetched?   I personally would set up a space just for this to try out myself if I could even code a game for it =\\

Vive,What has changed on the Original Vive since release?,"Another post was asking if buying a used original Vive headset was still worthwhile and a good introduction to VR. It had some good answers which helped me, but the questions I have now are a little different.

(Honestly you can probably skip the big wall of text here and just skip to the questions at the end. This is just background about why I am asking and is included to help you all provide better recommendations.)

Background: I have spent most of today watching and reading reviews on the various main brands of headsets, (Valve Index, HTC Vive, Vive Pro, Cosmos, and the Oculus Rift, Rift S, and Quest) and haven’t really gotten as close to a decision as I would have liked. At the very start, before watching any reviews, I was considering a Vive Pro because I could find “used” ones (minor cosmetic damage kind of used) for ~~~$500,~~ now seeing more like $700-$800 (I was probably remembering that price entirely wrong) but a lot of the reviews I have seen have made me realize that’s not really what I’m looking for. I don’t really want to go for an Oculus because Facebook owns them and I don’t want to support their rampant privacy invasion. That’s just a personal choice. I more recently have been considering a refurbished/used Vive from the Vive website (so technically “Certified, Pre-Owned”) which are only $400. I have played with a friend’s PlayStation VR and I enjoyed it, so I have no reason to believe I’ll hate VR entirely, but I’d rather not spend $1000 on an Index and then use it only a handful of times. I *could* afford it, but I’m just not comfortable spending that much when I don’t have much experience yet. The common opinion seems to be the Cosmos is garbage so I’m steering clear of that for now. I’m open to lesser known brands as long as the headset is still decent, but I have yet to really come across much on them other than they exist.

I intend to be using the headset with my PC (Windows), primarily for games. One I’m excited for at the moment would be Subnautica because that was a great game and will hopefully be a whole new experience in VR. I’ve got a good space that I think should well behind my desk.

A lot of the reviews on the original Vive that I have found are from 2016 and seem to be from around the time of release. Obviously things have changed since then, which brings us to...


*Question 1:*

What has changed and been fixed since release? What concerns of the reviews from release can I ignore?

*Question 2:*

Are there other headsets that you all recommend I look at?

*Question 3:*

In the aforementioned post, someone recommended the Samsung Odyssey Plus. I’ll be looking for reviews shortly but I wouldn’t mind some more input on it. Does anyone have experience with it and care to share?


And in general, any advice you can offer to help me on my search would be appreciated!

Edit for fixing some information, at to add another question:

*Question 4:*

How important is accurate tracking? What are the effects of inaccurate tracking? This keeps coming up in reviews and I realized I don’t understand yet what difference that actually makes. It’s one thing for your hand to “float away,” but is it really that bad to have it a few millimeters out of place?",1575787124.0,1,9,129422

Vive,So 1.0 hardware is compatible with Base stations 2.0 but 2.0 hardware isn't compatible with base stations 1.0? Is that correct?,"I'm a little confused. (editing for clarity because I butchered the title)

It seems that **v2 headsets and controllers** *are* compatible with **base stations 1.0**.

But **v2 basestations** are ***not*** compatible with **v1 headsets and controllers**?

Meaning, if I upgrade my base stations to v2 buy purchasing the index kit, they will **never** work with OG vive controllers, pucks, HMD etc?

Having forward compatibility but not backward compatibility seems, dumb to me. Maybe I'm reading this wrong.

Edit: ok so I'm not reading this wrong, Basically, if I upgrade to an index and EVER find myself in a situation where I want to go back to the old controllers, or maybe get a vive pro, I have to downgrade the base stations.

I've recently added Sansar to my list after a fellow Redditor alerted me to its support (thank you)!  Without further adieu, my current list:

Vive,Vive Intermittent Fault - Loses Stereoscopic View,"My Vive (original) has developed a weird intermittent problem. It randomly stops displaying the image stereoscopically. Or else it suddenly decides to display completely the wrong projection for stereoscopic viewing.

It plays normally for maybe 10 or 20 minutes, then suddenly it'll decide to no longer display a stereoscopic image. Both eyes are rendered and both displays are on and working, but either both eyes are displaying the same image or the image is displayed in completely the wrong stereo projection and it becomes unviewable. If you close one eye it looks fine but not with two eyes.

If you put the headset down and let it go into standby, then pick the headset back up again the image is then fine and rendered correctly.

Does anyone have any ideas?

Thank You",1575728795.0,1,0,129422
Vive,"We released our new update ""Tesseract Abyss"" for Swords of Gargantua","Hi all,

We released new free DLC for Swords of Gargantua, called Tesseract Abyss!

It's a rogue-lite mode that can be done solo or through multiplayer. Players move downwards into the ""abyss"" fighting in different areas that are chosen from a random selection after each stage.

Along the way you'll earn power-ups, can collect weapons, craft them into stronger weapons and level up your own character's base abilities. There'll even be a shop that appears from time to time which you can buy items (like power-ups and health) through the coin you earn by winning battles.

If you die, you'll carry everything over into the next play minus your initial level. It's pretty tricky so you'll most likely die a few times. Looking forward to seeing everyone progress through it!

Please check it out and let me know what you think!

The other one works perfectly fine and while plugged in it tracks perfectly fine, but if it's not plugged in it will only turn on and not actually connect, having the blue light instead of green.

I saw a suggestion someplace saying that the bluetooth something or another might have died inside the controller, but I'm hoping that's not the case, cause one of these controllers is $120 and christmas just blew through my wallet. If it is, do I need a whole new controller or is there a way to fix it?

Might be worth noting that last time it was working was playing beat saber. The wireless battery pack died while playing and the next time we tried was when the controller stopped working.",1575697615.0,2,2,129422

Vive,Fatal Error in Company-Made VR Game (UE4),"I work for a certain barcade chain, and our VR ride is *really* pooping the bed these last few weeks.

I have VR myself at home, a Vive as well, and the games run through Steam VR and a few other internal systems, so I’m really hoping it has something to do with the ‘public’ software.

The games based in Unreal Engine 4, and was never designed to use a Tracker, but we do anyways. It was tacked on right before it shipped, probably because it’s a buggy mess.. One of the PCs has been coming up with ‘Fatal Error’ when trying to start the experience.

And it doesn’t happen consistently either, about 80% of the time it’ll crash, then it’ll work for no apparent reason. What’s going on?

Vive,OG Vive Motion Blur and Warping,"I have the OG Vive and this problem started suddenly about a year ago. I first noticed it in SteamVR home with the text that shows your games and other rooms you can join. If I move my head, the text will warp and trail. It is worse as I turn my head and look through the periphery of each lens. Happens equally on both sides. Once I keep my head still, it mostly goes away. Most all games are still playable, but if I stand still in a game environment and move my head around, I can see the environment warping a little bit as well. Issues I've ruled out are any headset adjustments (IPD, lens distance) and headset positioning on my face. I turned off motion smoothing and toggled a few software settings without success.

System specs are: 

OG Vive w/ original lighthouses

GTX 970 x 2 in SLI (Old I know. Tried to fix the problem by separating SLI and switching from one graphics card to the next, neither of which fixed it, so I put them back into SLI).

i7 4790K 4ghz

16gb DDR3 ram

Any ideas as to why this might be happening and is there anything else I can try? I'm hoping my lenses haven't become damaged over time, but the problem is equal in both eyes, so I suspect a software, graphics card, or headset problem. Things are still playable, but seeing the trailing and warping is very bothersome.",1575660623.0,1,2,129422
Vive,"So, what actually is the upgraded/second gen. of Vive? The Cosmos? The Pro?","So I've just been getting really interested in getting a VR headset. It's always interested me, but now I'm am feeling really close to pulling the trigger. But, when looking through the deals on Black Friday and Cyber Monday, I almost came out of it more confused. It really seems like the Rift S could be okay because I like the controllers, but the lower refresh rate, and the fact that Oculus is Zucc tech, pushed me away from it pretty quickly. The Index is still a little too high for my liking (not saying it's not worth it, just that I don't feel like splurging). WMD's are better than you expect but still have tracking issues. So, I usually end the thought process that Vive is the way to go.

But I don't really know what to get. Spec-wise, the OG Vive seems a little old for me regarding resolution specifically, but as a whole I still don't feel like it's enough. I don't know where the road goes after that, though. The Vive Pro looks pretty good spec-wise, but without having any controllers or lighthouses right now, I'd be better off getting an Index. The Cosmos looked like it might've been what I was actually wanting, but I've only heard bad things of it. In the end, I almost am where I start in the beginning because nothing feels right for me to buy. Is there anything down the pipeline that might be popping up, like more upgrades or updates? Maybe some new headsets I don't know about?",1575571429.0,75,106,129422

Vive,HMD weighs more on one side? (Original Vive),"I just got a (Used) Vive today after using an Oculus for the last 1.5 years, and have been playing around for a little bit, and I have noticed the right side weighs down on my head considerably more than the left, and sits crooked on my face most of the time. I'm always grabbing the headset and readjusting it because my right eye is always off center except for the few seconds I readjust before it falls away again.

&amp;#x200B;

I've tried pulling the cables out just a bit from the headset to loosen the slack, and that did not help, and i have the vive delux strap on. I've tried looser and tighter, adjusting my ipd even to see, but nothing alleviates it.

&amp;#x200B;

It's really quite frustrating, Did I do something wrong with the strap or something?

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: Re put on the strap and am wearing the hmd much tighter and it seems to fit on nicely. It's not on painfully tight or anything, just much more than I'm used to with the oculus. So far so good now!

I am wondering.. if you top these up and then put them in a drawer for a few months, will they be drained dry? Assuming Lithium based batteries, they should not go too low or the battery cells can be destroyed ..

I've refunded half a dozen games already because they were just pure garbage.

Oh and then there's a few multiplayer shooter games. Competitive games are a young man's crowd.

I am so excited about this VR headset and yet I don't feel like there's much left to do with it. 

Beat Saber is fun, but I've never been big on rhythm games.

Blade &amp; Sorcery is insanely fun for a few hours, but even with all the mod support it's still basically the same thing over and over. Also I am not looking forward to explaining myself to my wife if she ever sees what I'm doing in that game.

Gorn is the same thing but now everything is made out of dildos or something. Pass.

Vive,audio distortion/weirdness on Vive Pro - USB C to 3.5mm workaround?,"hey folks, i know this has been talked about a lot, but not recently - furthermore all the threads i searched are archived so i can't bump a topic, so i'm forced to retread old ground, of sorts.

anyway i'm a teacher at a university and we purchased a Vive Pro headset which worked fine with a older desktop. then we switched to a laptop - Alienware 17"" - and now from the Vive Pro's HMD audio  i'm getting very strange digital artifacts - buzzing, chirps, etc, especially when playing audio that stops and starts. the laptop's speaker and headphone audio are totally fine. so, i did a lot of diving into reddit threads to find that there are a lot of variations on this issue, and it seems to be related to the 'Vive Pro Mutimedia device driver' (yes it's accurately misspelled) which seems to be a USB Audio device going out to the Link box. i did testing outside of VR just in a browser opening up Youtube and setting the laptop to use the Vive as the audio output, and the audio had the same glitchy behavior, so it's not just in VR that the issue happens, at least for me.

fixes i've tried:according to one account, the NVIDIA HD Audio drivers were possibly interfering. so i removed them, and just used the 'Mutimedia driver'. no change in behavior. then i reinstalled the HD Audio drivers and disabled the non-HD driver. same effect - no change. i've unplugged the link box and restarted it, and it doesn't seem to do anything either. however running a long audio cable from the headphone jack on the laptop to a set of earbuds resulted in clear, glitch-free audio, though now with two cables to deal with instead of one. one thought i did have concerning the new SteamVR audio oriented update (1.8) that just dropped, is i wonder if it actually was a step backward and is causing these issues. would love to rollback to an earlier driver to test but search results covering how to downgrade SteamVR are depressingly sparse to non-existent.

so continuing from the workaround perspective, i'm aware that you can purchase a USB C to audio adapter hooked up to the port on the HMD, but curious what's a good one? would i need one with a right angle USB connector so as to be unobtrusive? if someone could help me with some product links i'd be grateful! likewise anyone with similar issues just to get confirmation or fixes would also be appreciated. thanks in advance!",1575525219.0,1,4,129422

Vive,Crazy behavior of one of two base stations 2.0,"Hey guys, I got the Vive Pro Full Kit yesterday and everything works fine so far. However on the Power Management Tab I discovered, that one base stations has a connection failure, it works absolutely fine while playing tho. I make it short:

\- Everything is freshly updated and on the newest version

\- Power Management: One BS is working fine the other has a warning sign: ""Connection failure, click refresh to try again"", when I turn off VR, the working BS is going into sleep mode (intended) while the other obviously not.

\- Channel Configuration: The BS is discovered and working, but I cant switch channels. When I click on it it says: ""BS requires a device update to enable channel configuration.

\- In the Device Manager (Windows 10) everything looks good.

\- The other base station is working absolutetly fine altho I updated both successfully.

\- Both work fine while gaming

Vive,The Cosmos is the right idea sold the wrong way,"I've had a chance to try out the Cosmos and quickly noticed it could have filled a niche in the market, but doesn't. It's strength is versatility, as it can do pretty much anything - inside out, base stations, wireless, etc. 

I think one reason it is failing is the lack of versatility in purchasing options. They should sell the headset cheaply with no faceplate or features, and let people purchase their favorite accessories seperately. Not many people will be happy purchasing it as is, bundled with junk at a premium price. For example, right now if you wanted to use base stations, you're still stuck paying for the cost of an unused inside out faceplate which is a large extra expense. 

The wands are absolute garbage and I think many people would be happy if they could combine index knuckles while using the Cosmos headset. Again you're forced to purchase spendy HTC accessories that are best left unused. With inside out, the tracking is at best marginal. However a huge mistake was needing a total of four AA batteries to run these things for just a few hours.  USB recharging is the only solution that makes sense, and adding more disposable batteries to an already crappy design is just a big step backwards. It's possible the inside out tracking can be further improved through firmware updates, and current users should consider themselves volunteer beta testers while they try.

All that aside, the Cosmos has some great video and audio qualities and is one of the more versatile headsets as far as possible options that can be added. The flip up option is pretty neat. Because it already comes bundled with all of the low end gear, anyone wanting to add stations or wireless is going to be out a ton of money, which makes a high end set a better option instead.",1575357826.0,126,54,129422

Vive,Is using a DVI/D to VGA to the monitor downgrade the VR experience ?,"Hello guys !

Just for some context (if you like to read my bad english, if not, TL;DR at the bottom), a friend of mine recently bought the HTC Vive, and because she didn't know how to set it up, i helped her throught pains and frustrations on mic.

The thing is, i sold her my old GTX 970 MSI (for cheap don't worry) to replace her old graphics card that wouln't have run anything anymore.

But when she had to plug things, i've felt dumb to not thinking about it; the HDMI cable was already taken.

For more context, the 970 has : 1 HDMI / 1 Display Port / 1 DVI-I / 1 DVI-D

Welp i quickly told her to buy an adaptator because her monitor has only a HDMI or VGA input.

So she went out to buy a VGA/DVI adaptator and everything went fine, until she started to play it and said it was ""quite pixely"". Note; i can't try this by myself as we are living 5 hours away, and my perception would have been corrupted by the Index.

By reading a tutorial [here on steampowered.com](https://support.steampowered.com/steamvr/HTC_Vive/) i've seen; *""If you don't have any HDMI output available, you can use a DisplayPort to Mini DisplayPort.""*

**So my question is:** Is using a DVI/VGA adaptator to the monitor change/downgrade the quality of the Vive ? I hope my english is understandable.

**TL;DR:** Friend new to VR, not enough ports at the back of the graphics card, switch the HDMI to the monitor to the VIVE and using a DVI/VGA adaptator to the monitor.
Friend complained about the pixely thing. Question is; does the adaptator change/downgrade the quality of the Vive ?

Vive,HTC Vive Pro- (Review and comparison with modded lenses),"\----TL:DR- Can skip to my 2 ¢ below----

I have had the original Vive for about 3 years or so and I wanted a higher resolution headset. I have not had a reason to upgrade HMD's and was holding off. With the recent announcement of Half Life: Alyx, Metal of Honor VR, and then Boneworks coming out in a few days I had the itch to burn some more money on this niche market. Well, Vive Pro was $200 off last week and was almost the same amount as the Index, headset only. The 120-144hz refresh rate of the Index and it still being $100 cheaper than the Vive Pro's (sale price) seemed like the way to go. But I wanted to retain my Vive Wireless attachment and Index does not have a solution for this yeeeet! So I got the Pro, watch the Index get some new tech right after this review and releases wireless capabilities...

I have modded the lenses, upgraded my pc more than enough (pretty much built a new one will show some specs below), added a Vive wireless attachment, wireless ModMic, deluxe audio strap, made some custom foam inserts/pads for added comfort or support, Index controllers, special straps for my Vive wands I made, and a few other odds and ends in order to make VR more enjoyable. I find many little things that annoy me and I have to tweak them. I don't play all the time but I still have logged around 600 hours or more in VR with more than 94 game titles. I play anything from Onward (161 hours played) to Beat Saber and Skyrim VR (with plenty of mods in both) so I would say I am a pretty big enthusiast and I love VR, I don't play many 2d games anymore after I got into it.

OG Vive has to have most of these mods in order for me to play them. Overall the one mod I have to have is the lenses, I can't STAND the Vive and Vive Pro's garbage fresnel lenses at all. I have a few friends who have the same opinion but get a lot of mixed reviews online about the lens swap. After a few friends purchased a Vive, after playing mine a few times, they then asked why mine looks so much better than theirs... the solution to this blurry god ringed ""high quality"" HMD is--- $30 Samsung Gear VR Lens Swap! + adapters. They went proceeded to get new lenses ASAP after I told them.

# ---- 2 ¢: REVIEW/COMPARISON w/ mod----

So I couldn't find anything besides reviews or comparisons on the stock headsets with the OG Vive and Vive Pro so I decided I would make an ass of myself reviewing these with mods. Well many people love the Samsung Gear VR mod yet many do not. I am not sure where people get the idea that the Samsung lenses cause some issue's and they revert back to the fresnel lenses saying they distort the view or they make everything look flat. I have heard this a few times, but have also seen Reddit posts that the reviewer said they absolutely hated the lens mod, just to see an update later saying they installed the lenses backward lulz.

I can say for sure, comparing the the Vive and Vive Pro was not seeming to be worth the money right out of the box the other day. God rays annoy me, the sweet spot is tiny on the OG and Vive Pro lens. The comfort of the Vive Pro is amazing and I can see me enjoying being in VR much longer... yet something seemed wrong about this upgraded HMD. I just dropped $600 on a headset and the resolution did not seem really any better. I couldn't read writing in the Steam Menu, distant Tree's in Skyrim VR were just as blurry as the OG Vive, and I really couldn't justify the headsets price. I was very disappointed besides the better weight distribution making the headset have a much greater wearability vs the Old Vive with a deluxe audio strap.

Swapping out the lenses I couldn't help but feel like I was going to be returning this new HMD as it wasn't worth the money first go, and instead maybe I could give my mother the money to get a new set of teeth. Thank god I was wrong she can continue to starve! NIGHT AND DAY difference in clarity, the sweet spot is improved, and god rings vanish into my terrible memory where I file repressed fragments of my past. But I have already seen this before with the OG Vive w/mod. The thing I really wanted was crisper distant objects, as this was the last thing I needed for a greater immersion. I could make out far off distant objects right away. In Skyrim, Onward, Fallout, and even modded games that are not meant for VR originally... you name it I can see it. Instead of a blob of a tree 100-200 or so yards out, I could see a tree with crisp lines and it not forming into the background like a terrible painting with the colors bleeding together.  *With the stock lenses on the Pro OR on the OG Vive w/ the mod*, this was always the case, distant backgrounds form together, as if you needed glasses and were nearsighted. Up close everything looked great, far away not soo much. But the Vive Pro lets me see a farther distance hands down with the new optics. I would seriously play a OG Vive with the lens mod over the Pro with stock lenses.

I obviously have a bias towards this mod over the stock garbage that who ever came up with should be euthanized, but I also understand these lenses really help people with motion sickness.

&amp;#x200B;

**Image-** Some say you lose 3d image with this mod, maybe it is a little more flat: *8.5/10 from the stock lens 7/10  w/mod*

**Sweet Spot-** Same as the OG Vive w/mod, but you get better FOV. The 15-20% sweet spot upgrades to like 70% w/ mod: *10/10, for both OG and Pro.*

**Clarity-** Distant objects, up close, writing/text all much easier to see now Hands down a *10/10* w/mod  from a *5/10 before*! Likewise with the OG Vive w/mod, but the Pro really has a lot more details at a distance than the OG Vive w/mod. This was what I wanted as I felt immersion in a game like Skyrim is thrown off by a bleeding together background.

**Field of View-** On the OG Vive w/mod you did lose a bit of FOV (5-8%) , but not with the Vive Pro thanks to the telescoping screen! With glasses, you will lose FOV and how much depends on how far they stick out, but I press these babies right up to by corneas so my I can have my ""retinas seared like tuna steaks"": 8\*/10\* as you get a little more binocular feel but not much as you may notice on the OG vive and that the Vives just don't have the best FOV anyway.

**Screen Door-** I did notice a tiny amount but even with the stock HMD, it is much less with the new rez of the Pro! Maybe a little more noticeable with the new lenses popped in but nothing you will see without really trying to notice it. Much better than the OG Vive! Especially in low light/high contrast locations: *8/10*

**God Rays-** The awful god rays are gone, but still get a little bit of haze/fog off of low light/high contrast area's (like if you are in a dungeon or crypt in Skyrim and the candles cause a awful god ray, you get a little haze, still 100x's better than being blinded by the fresnel lenses).

**Performance-** This does not really pertain to the mod, but overall some games don't like the wireless with the higher resolution. Most dev's have done a great job and they work fine. In less optimized games you might have to kick the setting back a little as I did with games like Cosmic Sugar. Which is almost unplayable for the Vive pro? =(

**Barrel Distortion-** There is some small distortion on the edges of the new lens like the old Vives mod, but it is easily changed with swapping some lines of code out. I did not test it without the new lines of code and I am using the 2nd set of upgraded ""code"". I think they have the 3rd set out now. Either way you have to look at the edge of your lens to see this and is not noticeable unless you are picky as all hell, in that case grow up children (as I sit here and complain about all the little things I hated on my OG Vive)..... hypocrisy at its finest!

Thanks for reading! Hope my incoherent rambling, poor grammar and nonsense was somewhat helpful.

*ME*\--*""I felt like I was wasting money after getting the Wireless attachment and not seeing much for new content coming out in the land of VR, after Half Life was announced I realized that the market was soon to explode and VR would consume my life.... well hopefully after wasting another $600+ on this crap""*

Vive,GearVR lens mod - distortion tips?,"Good day,

I was able to get my hands on a 2016 GearVR for $20 and a buddy printed me the lens adapters, so I went ahead and did the lens mod.

Amazingly clear. Fantastic.

Naturally there is some distortion and I applied a bunch of the various fixes. Some worked better than others, and now I am trying to dial it in with  SteamVR-Undistort, starting with the V3 profile. 

Having some success, but I'm wondering if anyone has tips on using it more efficiently? 

As well, I've read that I should do it with the green crosshairs, but is this the crosshair with all the hash marks, or the simple crosshair that's just two intersecting lines?

Cheers.

Update:  got it all dialed in, almost completely perfect! Used V4 of the distortion fix and did a bit of additional tweaking in the Undistort tool, pretty much just around the edges. For $20 this had a major impact on my experience, I love it.

I also see why some people can't stand it, before I got it dialed in (took hours and tried every version of the fix I could find) this made me fairly dizzy and looked really distorted. It seems you need the patience and time to really fiddle with it for this to work well for some people, although my wife threw it on (before it was dialed in) and couldn't see any distortion at all.",1575321744.0,5,24,129422

Vive,VIVE official certified pre-owned nightmare.,"I've been really wanting to get VR for years now, and just this black friday weekend the vive store was selling them for $350 certified pre-owned, free shipping and everything. Great! So I ordered it, it shows up today, and I can't wait to get things set up. Once everything is set up, all I gotta do is plug in the Linkbox and the headset. So, I go to plug in USB, HDMI, and then.. the power cable was the wrong size. I go and check and my heart sinks. I got three identical power cables and they only fit the base stations. I guess the third one was supposed to be the power adapter that would've fit the Linkbox to power the headset, however, that cable is too large to plug into the Linkbox. It only fits the base stations.

Has anyone else received the wrong power adapter? HTC wasn't much help with support. They offered to have me pay to ship it back, wait a few weeks, and eventually get an answer. Or, wait a few more weeks to get the right power adapter sent to me as they were apparently short on supply.",1575330632.0,2,11,129422

I told him (by text) buy a couple Rift S's today on Cyber Monday for $700 total and go to Best buy and tell them you want a minimum of i7 7700k, GTX 1060, 8gb RAM

Also: he wants to play online games with me since he never gets to see me so I thought we could play VRChat and Pavlov

Can this* PC run both smoothly? (I sent him the link)

I spent a good 6ish hours getting project cars working decently enough, and it's pretty awesome. The rendered interiors are amazing, and the hud is pretty cool too.

Either I'm way ahead of everyone, or I get behind and it feels like there is no possible way to catch up.

Yesterday my headset crashed (black screen in headset, no longer being picked up by base stations) and SteamVR said I needed a firmware update for my headset.

Firmware update fails. Says I need to plug in my headset to the computer or try unplugging headset and plugging it back in.

Best I can tell from Steam VR Troubleshooting, and Vive and Viveport troubleshooting, you shouldn't need to plug in a wireless adapter headset to update the firmware.

I've rebooted the USB and reinstalled them, with no luck. 

My SteamVR is currently in a loop of knowing it needs to update drivers and the updates failing. 

I don't have the Pro, but I do have the wireless adapter, so I think I'm in this odd middle ground in terms of places to go for troubleshooting.

Vive,Minimizing VR UI Friction in Fast-Paced Combat,"After dealing with the UI system in Skyrim VR which pulled you out of combat every time you wanted to change attacks, I wanted to create a UI system which effectively allows for real-time combat in non-shooter games.

[My solution](https://i.imgur.com/83GKOGT.mp4) is to have four anchor-points around the screen which, when grabbed, each activate a unique spell. Similarly, different variations of any skill can be toggled by grabbing and quickly releasing any anchor point which effectively allows for real-time access to up-to eight spells. With the Index's large FOV, enough room is left that the viewing experience still feels uncluttered.

There is also an added benefit that four stationary points around the edges of your screen gives you a constant point of focus which can somewhat reduce motion sickness in some people.

Vive,How do I make Vivecraft Seated Mode feel more realistic?,"Hello, I am thinking about playing Vivecraft and I don't have alot of money, so I saw a guide that allows you to play Vivecraft with google cardboard. There is one issue, though, you can only play Vivecraft with google cardboard in Seated mode and not standing up mode. 

That kind of sucked because I don't like how the HUD is straight up over your arm and the mouse is just weird and you can't really use your headset to determine where you are looking and Standing Up mode just feels and looks better, but because of my super low budget, I might not be able to achieve that.

I did some research and found some driver application that allows people to use Wii Remotes as controllers, so maybe I could use standing up mode like that with Wii Motion Plus controllers but the application software costs quite alot, most people do not recommend using Wii Remotes as controllers and the free trial of it kind of sucks.

So I was wondering, is it possible to maybe change how Vivecraft works in Seated Mode so that whenever I move my head, the crosshair moves with the tracking of my head so that I don't have to move my mouse around to aim at where I want to break blocks? I mean, it seems kind of useless to be able to move your head around full 360 degrees, but not be able to aim where your cursor crosshair is.

I was also wondering if I could use Seated Mode whilst standing up so that I could feel more immersed by moving my head and body around whilst using some sort of joytokey software to bind controls to a controller for fun.

(I had an htc vive for 3 years and have had the index since it came out to major market). And i really think I'm missing a game that I would think is super fun. I really like plane games, because planes are just cool. And generally they are combat ones like war thunder. But I want one that has an airplane, maybe 2 seater with a pilot and a gunner in the back like early ww2 american planes. Or maybe a full bomber with like 7 people in it, but ita not just where you are controlling everything like war thunder. It should be like star trek bridge crew, where one person controls everything. And maybe if theres not enough people switching positions.you have to fight off enemy aircraft, get bombs ready to drop, drop them and fly back safely. ( game would probably last like 20 or 30 mins like the submarine game, which is good but not exacly what I am looking for). And I dont want to stop at just aircraft. So for tanks they can have a driver, gunner/loader(being a loader would be boring unless its shared with the commander, maybe there is a loader which is a commander ane has a machine gun to use for AA or for ground troops.) And a machine gunner up front too like a sherman or something. A tank game like this would be absoloutly amazing.

Vive,I’m in the market for a VR headset since Black Friday is going on. Is buying a VIVE used worth it?,"I was pretty set on buying a VIVE until I realized they aren’t restocking them. I see a lot of people on here selling their old VIVEs. I’d prefer to have original packaging in order to help my dumbass set the damn thing up, but other than that I’m fine with buying used.

Would it be more worth it to get a new Rift S instead? I’ve always thought of the Rift S as inferior to the VIVE, but I’m not quite sure how inferior it is. I’m also not interested in the Quest since it plays like shit in VRchat. I’d like my money to be worth it. Any help would be appreciated, thanks!",1575065807.0,3,14,129422
Vive,HTC VIVE Bluetooth questions...,"Hey, so I've had my Vive for a year now, and since I got myself a newer phone (Xiaomi MI5) {I had a rusty iPhone 5s xD} and decided that I could pair it with the headset so that I could know if someone's calling, texting me etc, but the damned thing keeps disconnecting after:

1: Turning on Steam Home

2: Turning on any game or app

3: Switching games/apps

Vive,PSA: The $5 Steam Controller can be harvested for parts to repair your Vive wands!,"I think this is fairly common knowledge, but as per subject the track pads in the Steam Controller are a 100% swap-out replacement for the track pads in the Vive wands.  As many of us have found out the hard way, those track pads will break the plastic housing and pop out (ripping the ribbon cable) with a solid crack against the wall at the wrong angle.

The only difference I've noticed in performing this operation several (4?) times now is that a) the Steam controller has only one fully smooth pad and b) the ribbon cable on the Steam controller is slightly longer than the native Vive wand cable, but still fits perfectly as a replacement.  Otherwise, the connector head, form factor, mount points and responsiveness are identical.  No glue, no nonsense.  Just swap the part and you're back in the game!

If your kids have VR Gorn parties, you will want a few of these ;)

I would always recommend pursuing warranty repairs if that is an option, but for most Vive owners, that is no longer the case.  You will of course need to watch a vid or two on carefully opening up your controllers and wands, but the operation is pretty straightforward, and doable with minimal experience if you have the right screwdriver.

With 4 boys and 2 VR rooms at my house, this has saved us a ton of money on repairs.  Highly recommended.  At $5 on sale right now, I suggest any Vive owner stock up and keep them in a closet as cheap spare parts!

Remember that each controller also comes with that magical Steam USB stick, so if you're upgrading to Index, you can use those dongles to pair your old wands as strap-on foot trackers...",1574902586.0,423,43,129422

Vive,How big of a difference will overclocking further make?,"Hey guys, I'm posting this here specifically rather than an overclocking forum because in VR we have other considerations, and a few FPS may well make a difference. I have an 8700K processor that is running at 4.8Ghz, but runs pretty hot at the moment at load, like high 80s, or low 90s, sometimes worse. I'm using the wireless adapter, and using FPS VR you can see that it does cap out my processor, not infrequently. 

So, the question for anyone who has tried is would it be worth delidding the processor, and maybe upgrading the cooler also? De-lidding would cost around $50 all told, and it looks like an upgraded cooler is more like $100. I definitely *could* spend that money, but it's not insignificant by any means. I'm guessing that doing both of these things would allow me to get up to around 5.2Ghz at slightly cooler temps than I'm at right now, as the cooler alone appears to give a 10-15c difference at load, and delidding is more like 15-20c, so that would be pretty significant together. 

How big of a difference would a 400Mhz be in terms of VR performance with the wireless adapter? If it's 1FPS, that's definitely not worth it to me. If it's 5-10FPS, it may well be.",1574981009.0,1,4,129422

Vive,My computer keeps crashing while playing VR,"So I got an RX 580 4GB refurbished graphics card from newegg back in July, and got a used Vive off craigslist in September. They've both been working perfectly for months with little to no problems arising. However, a few days ago when I was trying to play beat saber, SteamVR kept crashing and so would Steam itself. After 3 or 4 tries, I restarted my computer and tried again. It still was acting a bit weird and took a long time to load, but eventually I got it to start up. Then last night I bought some new games, the seemingly problem one being sprint vector. I had my friends try it out and when they were selecting the character it kept getting errors saying ""out of memory"", which is weird because I have 16GB of ram in my computer. After it crashed twice we went back to beat saber. After about 20 minutes of playing, it randomly crashed my whole computer. We turned it back on and now every time I try to play it, it lasts about 3 minutes before crashing. My question is, what is the problem? My first guess would be the graphics card since it was refurbished, but the low memory error I keep getting makes me think it might be the ram. Below I have the specs to my computer. (I'm kinda hoping it's the graphics card so I can upgrade to an RTX)

A lot of times when I want to quickly access my desktop from within VR I'm greeted by a full-screen game window with no way to close or minimize.

Vive,Index controllers + Pavlov VR = wow,"I just received my Index controllers.  Figured I was going to get them with Alyx, so I might as well get them now.  

So far I've only used them with the lab program as well as Pavlov VR since Pavlov is the main game that I play these days (close to 700 hours logged in it).  

It took about 30 minutes to get comfortable with the new mechanics, but once I did, holy crap.  Pavlov is really a very different game with the new controllers, and I'm guessing the same is probably true for other games as well.  

It's much better.  Way more immersive.  The main mechanic I had to learn was holding the gun.  The default position is an open hand as in normal life.  But if you do that in the game, you drop the gun (unlike with the wands where you hold onto the gun until you release them with a button click).  In order to hold onto the gun, you have to close your grip around the controller as you would close your grip around the grip of the gun.  Makes sense.  But the really cool thing is when you grip with the other hand as well.  You just grip your other controller as you would in real life.  No buttons.  It took some getting used to, but after I did, I found it much better, faster, and more intuitive.  

And then there's picking things up.  Medicine bottles, grenades.  Holstering, putting primary guns on your back.  Pavlov is a super great game, don't get me wrong, but there is quite a bit of room for improvement for interactivity.  Things are a little glitchy, but the new mechanics really got me thinking 'Man, this is incredibly realistic, more immersive, and in a way that really improves gameplay.'.  

I found that even within 30 minutes of getting used to the new controls, that I kinda had an advantage over the players who didn't have the Index controllers.  I noticed that the controllers were less in the way, and that I was more 'in the game'.  I could fire the pistols more easily and accurately, even the Barret.  But as I said, it improves the game play and the ability of the player to perform  in the game in the right way.  

Then there's flipping people off.  I'll be like 'hey, come here'  to a teammate.  I come over to him real close and then slowly and gingerly reveal my middle finger.  Its' really awesome.

Vive,Question regarding the Lighthouse Placement (Gen1),"Hey guys,

I just have a quick question regarding the placement of the lighthouses of the HTC VIVE, so the old ones, not the new ones.

I have this room ([https://imgur.com/a/SJuWX8T](https://imgur.com/a/SJuWX8T)) and want to place them bove on the wall where the dart board is placed. One in each corner. The wall is 4,10 meters wide, so they are probably about 1,90 to 2 meters apart when I put them up. Also the wall has a height of 2,60 meters and I am planning to put them up at around 2,40 meters. The direction I would mainly look while playing would be away from the wall, so facing towards the location of the picture taken.

Would this placement be possible with using the sync cable connected to both lighthouses?

Vive,Are there any good articles about the performance improvements from the HTC Vive Pro Eye?,"Its been a while since I've read anything about Foveated Rendering.   Im using a Rift so I dont always keep up with the news from the Vive side of things.  But the Vive Pro Eye was release earlier this year right?  Are there any good articles  with real world testing, about how much the foveated rendering actually reduces GPU workload?  I have seen things where Oculus stated in some of their testing, the foveated rendering allowed for a 20x savings in what needed to be rendered.  Im just curious what this looks like in the real world currently.      I want to know what peoples opinions are, that have used it.  Ive got a 980ti and a 6700k right now.  Id love to hear that with foveated rendering, that those specs would become more than enough for future High end headsets since it only renders such a small area at full resolution.

&amp;#x200B;

I know foveated rendering is still very new and still being worked on, and everything is subject to change.  Im just wanting some good stuff to read, thats not just from keynotes or development articles,  to keep me hyped for when it does go mainstream.   I just want to see how the current version has been working for people with real world examples.   Ive tried finding some stuff to read or watch, but all i can find just seems to be stuff from early this year, before the headset was launched.

When I kill some of these, they instantly come back sometimes opening something related to SteamVR, such as ""Pair a controller.""

I will say I am happy with my purchase, it takes a brain rework to ""let go"" of them after years of holding the wands constantly. It has to be said, the tracking is amazing.

Vive,Is the HTC Vive still worth it now? (Looking forwards to Half Life: Alyx),"Hey,

I was considering buying the standard HTC Vive (£500) for Half Life: Alyx. I obviously will play other VR games too.

My Dad hates the idea of buying a VR headset that has already been out for 3-4 years and is utilsing ""older tech."" Although I see his point, I don't agree with him saying I should instead buy the ""newer tech"" such as the Steam Index for basically double the price (£900).

Can you outline the advantages and disadvantages around this? I understand the Steam Index has better resolution, refresh rate, fov over the Vive - however that's obviously to be expected for a newer product. I can afford the Steam Index but it is still very expensive.

So, is the HTC Vive (The standard version for about £500) worth it as of 2019/2020?

Vive,New VR (oddly shaped) space...a bit stumped on solution,"I have an OG Vive and used it in my old home office/computer room which was a normal rectangle shape, so easy-peasy setup. A few months ago I moved and my new home office is a loft which is actually waaaay more spacious, except that the ceiling is a sharp slant downwards. One side of the room is a good 20ft tall, the other end is 4ft.

The vive trackers say a minimum height of 6.5ft above the ground is required, so I can't place a tracker at the 4ft side of the room...so my only option is to awkwardly place one in the middle of the ceiling slant and cut my play area in half.

I was really looking forward to the **Cosmos** because it seemed like a great upgrade to the Vive and with inside out tracking it would solve this issue. Unfortunately I've just not been impressed with the reviews or hardware, and unfortunately this room is pretty dark most of the day, which I hear doesn't work well for the Cosmos.

I've also heard the **Valve Index** base stations can track without a minimum height (even though they recommend 6ft - it can be used at any height, so my 4ft wall will be fine). That said, the $999 price tag on the index is just a bit steep...

I've been pretty amazed by what **Oculus** has done with the quest and quest link. Having a truly on-the-go VR headset and a PC one is something I thought was years away. That said, I'm worried about it being a visual downgrade even from the OG vive. If I am going to be spending $$ to buy something new, I'd like it to be an improved experience in some way. I'd love to hear if I'm wrong about though!

So, this is where I'm a bit stuck. I'm not sure what the best path forward is for VR right now in my space without spending a ton of money or downgrading the experience slightly. Unless the Vive trackers *will* work with one at &lt;6.5ft after all (if anyone has experience with such, please let me know!).

I 100% lurked on this community for the past two years but I will not forget everything I’ve learned. All the niche games I found out about, quality of life settings, tutorials, etc.. Thanks guys! Here’s to the future of VR!

Edit: For those of you who wanted me to give my 2 cents on the upgrade. I think that it is well worth it. One of my few complaints is that if you have a big head then the shroud that sits on your face may be a bit snug on your temples and give you a pressure headache but with precise tweaking of the knob on the back plus the strap on top you can get it feeling pretty damn comfortable.  For image quality I think that this is well worth the upgrade. You become so much more immersed in the games you are playing when you aren’t constantly distracted by the screen door effect. One last thing, setup was beautifully easy especially since I already had mounts for the base stations. The software also doesn’t make you plug in the base stations to update them which is really nice. If any of you have any tips on where I could started figuring out how to correctly tweak my settings to get the best image quality to performance ratio I would greatly appreciate it. When I first started playing around with the headset my global resolution was set to 136% (what it was set to for the Vice).

Vive,Anywhere I can try an Index in the UK?,"I've posted a couple of times on my city's subreddit, despite being a huge city (Bristol), nobody has ever responded.

I don't mind travelling a little ways to try it, plus I'll be travelling up north before and during Christmas (and back, afterwards) so I'm reasonably flexible about location.

But I've had an OG vive since release date, and while I love it, I don't use it much because it's not the most comfortable to wear and it's such a faff - I know I should get the deluxe audio strap as half my faff is with sorting headphones out, and that thing is still ridiculously expensive. With the Alyx announcement I am considering an upgrade to the Index but I just want to try it first to make sure.

I recall with the Vive they demo'd it in various places, shopping malls, and various video game shops, but the Index? I can't find a whiff of it!

So I have a weird issue now after a year of using my Vive (The exact same Issue was btw the reason i gave back my Oculus to get a vive) Also i had this Issue after 2 Months but it randomly dissappeared. So whenever i Want to play a VR Game i set up the Sensor boxes and plug in the Cable box thing and then plug in the Vive. But since 2 Weeks the LED only lights up in red. Now heres the deal: I checked the hdmi cable, used a different one, checked the Cables  and ports on the vive, checked the hdmi and usb ports on my computer and reinstalled Steam VR. Nothing helped. When I plug the vive in the light is giving me hope that i could use it, but nope. The Second i start steam VR it just changes to red telling me that i am a complete failure and dissappointment in life. Steam Vr then tells me that i am currently playing steam VR changes after 5 seconds to ""searching for your headset"" and then just goes ""steam VR couldnt detect any headset"" While this happens i hear the classic Windows ""device disconnected"" and ""device connected"" sounds multiple times... The onyl thing i could imagine is to check the USB cable. I am gonna order one now to check on later this day. But still i .. jsut feel like thats not the reason.

Does anybody know what else could be the reason and what else i could try?",1574733136.0,1,5,129422

It works pretty much exactly as you think it would; swinging your arms back and forth would make you move forwards in the direction you swing your arms. You can even go backwards if you do the movement behind your back.

It may look silly, but personally it's been the best control scheme I've used. It gives a bit of exercise, it's easier to control where you're going and how fast you're going (your max speed is dependent on your personal speed), and it's been super-fun to use in general. Seeing all these games stick with either dashing or just a single joystick for movement feels disappointing, as there are other, more innovative and fun ways of moving about.",1574676997.0,16,33,129422

I usually wear glasses, but my glasses fit inside the Vive pretty well. Regardless, I decided to wear my contacts to play to really get that VR feel. But that's not the main problem. When I put on my headset, the only place where the views aren't blurry is when I have to push my VR up. Otherwise, the headset tends to sink down and rest right under my cheekbones. I have pretty high cheekbones, so that might be one reason, but another issue is that when the headset slides down, it also almost pulls my cheeks down and my eyelid is stretched down too. I'm not sure how I can fix this or if this should be normal. My eyes feel dry and irritated in just \~10 minutes of gameplay.

Vive,Advice on lighthouse placement with 3 base stations (part deux),"*My original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/Vive/comments/dmsxlx/advice_on_the_placement_of_20_base_stations_in_a. Making a fresh post since I ended up buying a third lighthouse and most advice was on two base stations.*

I've been playing VR for a month with temporary placements at E, on the island between G and D (where the second chair is) and at C behind the couch. So far it's going good. Sometimes I'm losing track on my left controller (facing the TV) but that might be due to the how placement of my temporary locations of the lighthouses.


B and C are not that convenient to wire power to them due to the many windows on that wall. There is a power socket at the bottom between B and C but there is no drywall to the top unless I buy a really long extension cable for the 12V. There is a small pillar as part of the frame of the window but its not ideal.

Floor plan: [top-down view of floorplan](https://i.imgur.com/bUh5zUp.png)

**Thoughts and notes on individual positions**

D has a large lamp in that corner which would occlude several angles if I mount it in the deep corner. A potential alternative is on the same wall as D but on the corner between D and F, It could potentially have a larger viewing angle. Might still need to move the lamp though.

E seems like a solid choice that covers seating VR and the majority of movements for room-scale.

**My concrete ideas on placement with 3 lighthouses:**

- **E, A, D**: With ""A"" a couple of feet to the right to be more in the center of the room covering the back of the play area. E and D cover both from the front but might be redundant. Possible occlusion by spectators in front of A.
- **E, C, D**: A variation of the previous where I swap A and C. Having C in the corner above the window prevents reflections but also is guaranteed to no not have any occlusion issues. It would also allow me to mount E deeper in the corner above the desk making it a bit less visible and makes cable management easier.

Seems like 2 pixels right beside each other .
Left one is stuck on green, right one seems to be stuck on a dark purple like color, or dark red.

Anything i can maybe do about this? Or is my hmd slowly on it's way to it's grave?

Not quite sure if they are stuck or dead.

I noticed this thanks to my vrchat friends bright orange hair.

I can't see it on black, only when there is dome color going on on those pixels, how brighter the color is supposed to be, the more it can be seen.

Was hoping to maybe squeeze a bit more life out of this hmd while saving up for either a Vive Pro HMD or Valve Index HMD. (Buying the Valve Index Controllers for sure, soon.)",1574533091.0,1,2,129422

So it feels like the only true option in the market is the Oculus Riff S, Quest, or Index - and given the price of the Index, I would imagine most people would are going to purchase and  Oculus. 

I think HTC is leaving a lot of money on the table in the VR mid tier market. It’s the perfect starter build for people who eventually want to build up to a Valve Index and they could be cashing in on the excitement.

My main priority is to play some games like Beat saber/vr chat/some simulators but would be nice if I would be able to run something that will allow me to headpat anime girls/slime rancher/minecraft or maybe other more demanding games like nostos/fallout4 (if these will work on basic vive, not sure if googles make impact on preformance).

Vive,Temporary lighthouse mounting fixtures?,"Hi.

I've just moved in to a new flat (apartment) and it's substantially nicer than our old one where I could just about get away with having black wires running up the walls. My SO is (understandably) keen that we keep it looking pretty fancy, too, and all the walls are white. So basically I think this means I'm going to struggle to 'integrate' my Vive's lighthouses (mk.1) with this new place's decor.

As such, I'm trying to find a temporary method of having lighthouses in the living room space, but these also can't take up much floor space because there's, well, not much floor space to take up. **I've seen the tripod stands** that people use but those would take up so much floor space that my play space would be tiny, I think. 

My ideal solution would be something like a picture frame but with a tripod mount instead of a picture and subtle hooks on the walls to hang the frames on, but I wonder if there's another solution with repeatable 'zeroing' - maybe something with magnets? - so that I don't necessarily have to redo the SteamVR room setup every time I want to play.

Also, I know you're supposed to not have any reflective surfaces in your space but I'm just not going to take our art down every time I want to play something - is there a solution to that other than taking down the art every time I want to play something, or maybe some tricks with regards to positioning the lighthouses so that this matters less?

Vive,Left eye showing up in right lens,"Hi,
For a while now, I've been having trouble with my Vive. On more intensive games, such as Skyrim VR and VRChat (thanks to custom avatars), I've been getting times where my left eye's display will be shown in my right eye. I've tried all of the following in order to fix it:

-Replaced the cables between the link box and the HMD twice

-Replaced the HDMI cable between the link box and my GPU

-Directly connected my HMD to my computer without the link box

Has anyone else gotten this error? I've noticed that it only really happens on intensive games where reprojection is high. I'm going to try to fiddle with some settings and see if that fixes it, but in the event that that doesn't work, does anyone have any suggestions? It's gotten to the point where some games are unplayable due to me having to keep my right eye closed to avoid motion sickness/dizziness/disorientation.

Disconnecting and reconnecting the HDMI cable on the link box seems to fix it, but only for a short while.",1574391142.0,0,1,129422

This seems like a big deal to me and got me thinking about the handful of local asynchronous co-op titles in the VR world like [Late for Work](https://store.steampowered.com/app/623540/Late_For_Work/) and [Eye in the Sky](https://store.steampowered.com/app/566700/Eye_in_the_Sky/). Has anyone tried this feature out with these games or others like them? I wonder how well it works because I feel like this has the potential to be a big deal for VR and VR adoption. Similarly to how [VRChat](https://store.steampowered.com/app/438100/VRChat/) has gotten so many people interested in the tech by playing with people in VR and sharing in their experience, this seems like it might add that same value to those games that have chosen to focus on the local multiplayer party-style experiences.

And another question - I wear glasses, do have minus 3 vision it's called here, not sure of the measurement system in your country my dude. So is it possible to wear glasses and the vr helmet, or you can customise the lenses in the helmet so you'll have 100% vision. Hopefully it is so.

It is more severe when I look around. There is no improvement standing a foot from (either) sensor in the corner of the room. If the system isn't grey screening, then the perspective drifts.

Note that, although my initial setup reads as correctly aligned (the red cone almost parallel to the green cone in the attached) that is no longer the case, as it suddenly shifts. This is approximately 30 degrees off of true measurement. The sensors are also at the corners of the play space.

I've also tested each base station individually by placing it in A mode. The drifting is only present on the red one, but both have issues with grey screening.

Anyhow, I've always been an Intel guy, but I don't care about the wireless adapter. Just thinking about my budget and wanting to not go crazy with it.

Any recommendations for a new rig? I don't want to go over... say... $350? If I can help it. I'm thinking maybe $120 for a mobo, $150 for a CPU, $80 for RAM.

Vive,Could HL:Alyx be the first true Index controller specific showcase game?,"Unlike Oculus with the Touch controllers Valve didn't drop any full-sized launch titles that either required Index controllers or had real consequence in using Index controllers.

Imagine a point in the game where you you need to maintain a specific squeeze pressure, not too much, not too little. That would be less fun to pull off with analog grips/triggers on Oculus Touch controllers and no fun at all to pull off with the analog pad on a Vive Wand. Folks asked to play Aperture hand lab with Touch controllers so they did it - but it's not at all a equal experience.

&amp;#x200B;

If Valve doesn't create an AA+ game that makes owning an Index controller worth the cost in a truly demonstrable and ""game changing"" way that eclipses Touch - who will?

Vive,Vive Wireless Quick Tips,"Been using Wireless for about 600 hours now, here's some tips:

\- Be super careful when you rest your headset backwards you don't bend your power or Vive Pro AIO cable! For whatever reason they though it was a good idea to use long straight cables, which you can easily push against and potentially damage.

\- The USB Power cable get hot! The USB A-A cable provided is absolute garbage and broke within a week for me, but yourself a thick A-A cable and be aware if it gets too hot it can cause your headset to disconnect.  I personally recommend buying a right angle USB cable.

\- 3rd party batteries are generally pretty decent, most 10k Mah batteries tend to get unreliable once they hit 25% - Either get two 10k batteries or one 20k. I personally run one 20k Mah battery taped to my headset which lasts around 8-9 hours.

\- You need a good processor to run Wireless, it tanks CPU usage. Running Vive Pro on an 8 core 5Ghz idles VR around 34%! Ensure you're running either an overclocked quad core or 6 core processor to avoid issues.

\- Wireless does overheat, I'm in Australia and it get quite hot. I would just recommend either using AC, or cooling it with a mini fan when it gets hot. This doesn't apply as much to standard vive as it outputs less heat.",1574140859.0,5,1,129422

While Steam may have a lot more VR games overall, they're often MUCH smaller and have MUCH smaller budgets. Sure, I could just use ReVive, but it's not always a perfect match.

Vive,"Today is the last day to use GonzoVR, ever","After a little over a year on Steam, we're shutting down GonzoVR for good later today.

We had a blast talking to the people who checked it out, and I genuinely have friends that I met in GonzoVR that I'm closer to than my meatspace-friends.

It's certainly true that our user numbers were never very large, but in the end that wasn't the main issue. We always felt that the first priority was to create something that people really sustainably enjoyed, and once we had that we would then focus on getting more broadcasters and users. The big problem was that the kind of experience that everyone enjoyed the most: small broadcasts with 3-6 people, could never be economically valid for a broadcaster. We tried a few things to foster larger groups while still giving everyone a chance to talk, but there is only so much speaking time to be distributed. As soon as someone felt that they weren't contributing, they would leave.

We're making a new application now that builds off of what we've learned that people want, and the kinds of social groups that lead to the most enjoyable experiences.

Anyway, as a final note, I just want to say thank you to everyone who took the time to try GonzoVR out, and leave a review. People saying nice things about our work was what kept us going for as long as we did.",1574028486.0,81,12,129422

Vive,Got GTA 5 VR working without VorpX. Veryjos injection / grandtheftvr.com mod gameplay. Can it get finished?,"I am getting into the veryjos GTA 5 Open VR that came out in 2015 or so and I have to say just as an injection into the Vive headset is perfect. Comparing this with the VorpX injection, i'm blown away on this one just on it's out of the box nature to work well and not make me sick. It's unfortunate that it only gives you a set of guns, and a taster of the game (although the experience is still really good) because I want to play the whole game in VR. This mod is  geared towards usb racing wheel users, which is why I assume it was set up to be used with only one controller. What happened to this mod's progress? SOMEONE GET THIS GUY A JOB AT Rockstar. The story campaign would be playable (despite weird glitchy cut scene stuff) and also the game in general if both controllers were put to use. With one controller I have trouble aiming and continuing on a straight path. It feels weird compared to set ups like onward.  


Also, the [Grandtheftvr.com](https://Grandtheftvr.com) mod works without Vorpx using this Veryjos OpenVR alpha, my only gripe with that is that you can't shoot out of the car like in the veryjos version. Also my previous experience with this mod was using Vorpx, and it was severely sickening and low frames per second. Playing the [grandtheftvr.com](https://grandtheftvr.com) mod with the Veryjos injection is much much more playable, like native VR. I also like how the control scheme is set up, even if I have to use VoiceAttack to jump into and out of cars. I'm still working on my voice attack bindings, and i'm hoping to bind a lot of the switching character stuff, the thing about voice attack is figuring out how long each button needs to be pressed so it's been not working perfectly. That's my fault though, as i said.  


What's weird is that after launching the grandtheftvr mod with the numpad, I decided to hit L and launch the Veryjos mod, and to my surprise I had a gun in each hand and could shoot both of them. Only when I moved away I noticed that veryjos mod gun was dragging behind and pointing towards me instead of where the controller was pointing. It's totally unplayable like this just to mention.  


I was going to buy myself a usb racing wheel so that I could hopefully get that working with the grandtheftvr mod (with more mods). I know it works in the veryjos mod and i'll give that a go as well, but i'm looking to do the campaign. I think if shooting a gun out of your car was added to the grandtheftvr mod then it would be totally playable with voice attack no problem because it runs great and the VR view just gives you a weird perspective during cut scenes. and you can't see the map unless you system button out to desktop view. but yeah no gun in car and you can't shoot the folks during the boat highway chase, ect.   


Is it me or can you not shoot the gun out of the car in the grandtheftvr mod? Maybe since i'm not using vorpx i'm missing a function? idk. You decide. Let know in the comments below. It would be nice if someone could fix these two mods up into a working mod, possible?",1573973008.0,47,18,129422

I tried switching the only functioning bluetooth dongle with a nonworking one on its (the one vive gives) hub thing.

This is very weird and frustrating to me, because when i connected the dongles directly through usb without the hubs, it shows in the ""bluetooth and other devices"" that i have 3 connected ""Watchman dongle"" so clearly they work?

So then why do the trackers not connect to them no matter what i do and how much i pair, and only stay with the blue light on?

I was looking at picking up a VR headset and was originally going to get the OG Vive as I had tried it out previously and really enjoyed it.

Got the  first htc vive with no deluxe audio and with the vive ugly wands.

Sadly....valve dont want my money so i cant buy a index in canada...but is the vive comos worth it? got a lot of comments about the rift or the quest as a better choice.

Vive,"So, is Vive lip tracker going to be a thing?","I recently started using the Vive Pro Eye in Neos for eye-tracking and the hardware for it is amazingly accurate. It tracks the eyelid, eye, and pupil movements. I'd love to see something for the rest of the face. 

Today, I noticed in the software about section for the tracking something interesting. There is a mention of a lip camera version. I was thinking maybe we could see this as an addon in the near future.

These items are permanent,  and are used to power up your character in many ways. For example  between sessions you can combine weapons to create stronger versions.  You can also use coins to buy health power ups.

Your  level will reset after each play but items and weapons will carry over.  You can carry up to four items / weapons into battle. Below is a link  to the full press release and screenshots. Do let me know what you  think!

Vive,Dement Demo Now Available,"Hello everyone!

We are pleased to announce the demo for Dement is now available. 

[https://store.steampowered.com/app/1022990/Dement/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1022990/Dement/)

&amp;#x200B;

What is Dement?

Dement is an open world survival horror game that has been in development for three years, and is available in early access now. Currently, the game has four of eight chapters, with most of the open world available. Throughout the early access period, we intend to pepper in new areas, weapons, and side quests while we continue to toil on getting the last four chapters done- and of course, fix any and all reported bugs. Purchase now and you will get access to ALL Dement content in the future, and be able to participate in the early access period. Suggestions are welcome; some have been made and already implemented!

&amp;#x200B;

Who is Paracytik Entertainment?

Paracytik Entertainment consists of mainly two people; one coder/designer and one writer. We hope to one day grow into something bigger, and to bring rich, fulfilling experiences to players everywhere. We want to be a part of a better gaming industry- one that focuses on games as art, moving stories, and engaging gameplay.

&amp;#x200B;

What can I expect from the demo?

The demo skips the prologue, and is the first three quarters or so of the first chapter on a 45 minute timer. The main menu, tutorial, and loading screens do not count towards the 45 minutes. If you die, half of the time since your last save will be returned to you. The first melee and ranged weapon will be provided immediately to speed up initial play. Expect to spend at least an hour playing this demo! If you get to ""The End of the Road"", tweet us a screenshot @paracytik for a congratulatory shout out! Good luck ;)

I just ordered a cosmos online, however I wasn’t privy to all this backlash circulating online regarding controller tracking, lowlight sensitivity. 

To anyone who owns this product, how are you liking it? Is it plagued with problems as described by some tech reviewers on YouTube? Or is this just a common hallmark of inside out tracking? I’m curious if people using the riftS or quest have similar issues regarding the controller tracking. 

Kinda wondering if I made a mistake , on paper the device sounded amazing. Either way I have a 90day return period if it doesn’t meet my quality standards. 

I am upgrading from the Rift CV1, so I’m hoping to see a massive improvement *fingers crossed*

I am super excited at the prospect of getting rid of the Fresnel lenses as they are the main source of my complaints with VR as a whole. Note that I can't afford to just upgrade to a better system as of yet, so that's not really an option.

I am looking at all the details involved and everything seems easy enough, but I have a couple questions about the 3D printed adapter that will be needed.

1: Is this still the best option for Gear VR (2016) to OG Vive adapter? :  [https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2837804](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2837804) 

2: If it is, which version would I be better off trying out, the fixed v3.3 or the adjustable v2.2 one?

Notes for 2: I do always use glasses with vive (as does my wife), but I don't know if it is necessary or even advised to go with the adjustable version. From the description, it appears that the maker still prefers the fixed version. I already feel like there's little to no room in the headset with my glasses and am hesitant to add anything extra in there.

3: Does the adjustable version need to be changed for each user, or is that a flat fix for the lens itself?

&amp;#x200B;

If anyone who has modded theirs and uses glasses can chime in, I would really appreciate a first hand accounting in regards to how the mod plays with glasses. Bonus points for anyone who shares the system with others with/without glasses to figure out how much of a pain changing settings are between users.

For those of you that own the regular Vive Pro or the Pro Eye version of the headset, I would like your opinions on a few things. Reviews aside, I'd really like to hear from typical users.

In your opinion, are the Pro Headsets worth an upgrade from the OG HTC Vive headset? (I'll either sell it to a friend or keep it for multiple users)

How's the audio quality of the speakers that come with the Vive Pro headsets? (I have the deluxe audio strap for my current Vive and the audio is pretty good on those) 

If you also use the Vive wireless adapter, were there any increase in latency or drops in performance?

Would 4 vive cosmos's work in this space? The issue then is I was planning to have a gun with vive tracker so then I am back to the original issue of tracking that, unless the cosmos can track vive trackers. I am also worried about how good the tracking would be with the Cosmos as well.

It was heaps cheaper than most of the others and it works really well. I need to train up a bit of muscle memory to get my left hand controller back to the right spot after changing mags but I could see I was getting better the more I did it.

Took 6 days to go from order to the UK and delivery to Australia and I've been poppin' sosigs ever since. :)

Vive,GrowRilla’s Next Content Update And Our First Reverse Sale," Hello everyone,

Salmi Games here. At the moment we are preparing for our next content update for our game [GrowRilla](https://store.steampowered.com/app/981880/GrowRilla_VR/). We don’t want to spoil anything just yet, but we have a [sneak peek](https://imgur.com/a/ZrJWkoM) of what you can expect.

With this update, we will raise the price of the game for the first time since we launched in Early Access a few months back. We’ve come to this decision after a lot of back and forth discussion internally, but in the end we feel $15/15€ price point more fairly reflects the value of our game than its original $10/10€.

The other thing we’ve tried to do (ever since our first VR game Late For Work) is to reward players who believed in us and took a chance on our games early in the process. If you supported us early, then you’ve gotten our games at their cheapest possible price. Thank you for your support! We appreciate everyone who’s tried one of our games, left a review or given us feedback.

So if you always wanted to buy the game (which you definitely did right) you can grab it now for $10/10€ or wait a week to get it for 15€! Think of it as a reverse sale.

Did we catch your attention even though you’ve never heard of our game before? You can find out more about our game [here](http://growrillagame.com/).

Thanks for reading. We are happy to answer any questions you may have in the comments.

Cheers,

Vive,Hope you redeemed your code more than a week ago if you pre-ordered the Vive Cosmos.,"I redeemed mine last Friday because I had accidentally paid for a month, and it only gave me 6 Months of Viveport. Here is the customer service response:

    Hi &lt;sirkha&gt;, 
    
    Thank you so much for the prompt reply. My name is Maria and it'll be my pleasure to follow up on your case.
    
    I can imagine this situation can be quite frustrating for you since you were not able to unlock the 12 months VIVEPORT subscription available for the VIVE Cosmos pre-ordered but let me explain to you a bit clearer the previous information. 
    
    I'd like you to think about the redeemable code as a key, a key you have to open a new code with specific features. According to your gift card, I can see you have the key available to use it until 12/21/2021, however, the subscription you unlock will depend on the current promotion you can see in our web page. 
    
    Since the 12 months code was available until 11/05/2019, all the codes redeemed after that date will unlock the present-date promotion, which at this time, is 6 months of VIVEPORT infinity. 
    
    I hope you've useful and clear this information and I'm sorry for the inconvenience. Nevertheless, if you need further assistance or if you have any questions or doubts, please don't hesitate in contacting us again, we will be here ready to help you with everything you might need. 
    
    Enjoy your coming week. 
    Sincerely,
    Maria

So does that mean you can subscribe for $5 a month and cancel anytime, or that its a year subscription, but the cost is $60 instead of $108?

Vive,Advanced Settings 4.0.0 we are in motion again.,"It's been a bit!
 
 
### **Due to safety concerns with how old OVRAS builds don't respond to SteamVR's new chaperone limits we can only recommend Version 4.0.0 at this point.**
This bears repeating. You could have chaperone misalignment with OVRAS 3.2.0 and older on the current SteamVR version. This majorly effects you if you like using our app for space-drag or especially re-directed walking.
Also, Valve changed some API keys, and now old versions will spam errors. This affects everyone.
 
**So now time for the good stuff?**
 
### What is this/Why do I care?
 Advanced Settings is an open-source free Dashboard overlay that is designed to give you access to many useful features.....
PTT, disabling chaperone, ""playspace mover"", ""floor fix"" among many many many many other features... see us on github at [OVRAS](https://github.com/OpenVR-Advanced-Settings/OpenVR-AdvancedSettings)
We try to develop and implement features that the wider vr community wants, (and is within reason XD)  hows our driv..... errr progress?
 
### HELP I HAVE ISSUES! or I just want to chat and ask questions.
 
We have a Discord at [https://discord.gg/vgvSkSk](https://discord.gg/vgvSkSk), can report issues there or help other people with issues
You can also post the issue directly on the Github @ [https://github.com/OpenVR-Advanced-Settings/OpenVR-AdvancedSettings](https://github.com/OpenVR-Advanced-Settings/OpenVR-AdvancedSettings)
As always you can leave your issues here I promise I look at them all.
 
### How Can I help!
 
Vr-er? - come join discord, report issues, test pre-releases, join the ritual to summon valve's flagship vr games!
Developer - come talk to us, do you want to add something.... assuming its within reasonable scope we probably would love to have it in!
Developer with lotsa free time - are you sure you don't want to re-vitalize input emulator it can do things we can't!
But Really what angle? honestly there is none, we love VR just like you all, and like providing the tool. If you really want to leave a donation you can donate to us individually [Kung's Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/join/kungvr), [Ykeara's Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/ykeara)
 
## Highlights of the update:
 
Motion should be fixed for all headsets!
Binding button to take you straight to the binding page
Color Control via gain. (index/vive/vive/pro) (this should have little to no performance penalty unllike overlay method)
offset profiles
pretty icons!
various optimizations.
 
Why 4.0.0 and not 3.3.0? - 4.0.0 is a breaking change, and as such certain old compatibilities will break specifically your old SuperSampling profiles, among some other items. **your keybinds will not be affected**
 
## [Download](https://github.com/OpenVR-Advanced-Settings/OpenVR-AdvancedSettings/releases)

Vive,Best Value Valve index combination?,"Hi,

I’m looking to buy a VR headset and I’m getting one later this year (Oculus Quest). I’m currently 13 years old and I’m gonna be getting a part time job in December (possibly earlier) next year at an IGA, which pays ~$10 AUD an hour, or at a McDonald’s, which from what I know pays ~$15 AUD an hour. All depending on which I may get hired for, if any. Since they aren’t the highest paying jobs, and that I’m also looking to build a PC around the same time, I’m wondering which combination of the valve index will be good for me. On the steam website, there are several different configurations. (Index, Controllers &amp; Lighthouses, Valve index and controllers only, Headset only, controllers only, lighthouses.)

I’m wondering, since the controllers and lighthouses work with the Vive, what configuration of it would be cheaper. 

Thanks!",1573469267.0,9,8,129422

Vive,Lag with hands extended out.,"Ok so this is an odd problem that i have had on and off for a LONG LONG TIME, but seems to have gotten worse recently.  


I just got the knuckles and they seem to be working great but this problem keeps coming up. Ill be playing just about any game, blade and sorcery, pavlov, or anything else standing. About 5 or 10 minutes into playing i will get a huge and i mean MASSIVE spike in lag. Unplayable. If i move my hands down to about my waist line the lag completely goes away.   


This is also accompanied by the steam menu acting oddly, by that i mean my right eye will blink on and off continuously as the whole menu is lagging severely.   


This is incredibly disorienting and ruins my experience quite quickly.   


Also it should be noted that when i play seated games like VTOL VR, i have no issue with this problem. It never surfaces.

Vive,Unpopular Opinion: I don't get the hype around Boneworks,"I am a fan of Stress Level Zero and I want to be hyped about this game. However, I am really confused on why everyone is so excited. I appreciate the amount of work that goes into creating proper physics in VR, but what about this game is more fun than the other VR games out there?

* The story seems like an afterthought, or at the very least we don't know enough to be hyped about it.
* Aside from destructible pieces of the environment, the combat doesn't look that different from other VR shooters out there.

For me a final game is about creating an cohesive experience for the end user, and from what I have seen it looks like they created an excellent physics engine for a game and then tacked on a game.

I want to be wrong, and I want to be excited. So r/Vive, change my mind...

**Edit:**

Based on the comments I now know the points below. It won't personally be a day 1 purchase for me, but I better understand why some people are excited.

\- This is exciting for people with knuckles controllers, so they can finally use them to their potential.  
\- There is still a lack of high quality VR games. So having a game with at least good physics is a step forward, and will encourage other devs to create these types of games.  
\- It will also have puzzles that use the physics.   
\- Combat options are more varied than I have seen... Though I still need to see what kind of crazy stuff I will be able to do.",1573251997.0,14,30,129422

Some players loved them and others just wanted to just keep busting ghosts. We decided to make this a separate optional challenge using a new system we're calling Relic Challenges. We just added it in the latest update which includes slightly re-balanced levels and additional types of these optional challenges to give players more variety in gameplay.

Vive,How The Scoring System Works In Pistol Whip,"When I first tried Pistol Whip at OC6, I was instantly addicted.

## Awesome Guns? Check. Great Rhythm Game mechanics? Check. Superpowers to dodge bullets and take on 100 people in 5 minutes? Check.

## All this wrapped into one epically stylized package that makes you feel badass like you’re John Wick when you play it? Check, check, check

The thing that stood out after playing it (for far too many hours the past couple weeks) was just how many layers of depth there is in it.

When you start out, you’re just learning how to shoot and dodge (basically trying to stay alive while you lament over how sore your legs are from doing so many squats dodging bullets), a little later, you learn how to shoot everything in time to the music and realize how great the flow is in the game, then finally, you learn the details of how scoring works and just go into this flow state each time you return to the game, partly making up your own rhythm each time you play.

Anyway, let’s jump right into how **scoring works** since the tutorial doesn’t cover some of these details.

The game initially ships with 30 leaderboards (10 maps with 3 difficulty leaderboards each).

## 1. Shooting

The aim of the game is accuracy and rhythm (besides Pistol Whips obviously, we’ll get to that). You can get up to 200 points per shot if it’s both:

1. **On beat to the song** (this gives 100 points)
2. **Accurate** (has to hit the enemy anywhere on their body, giving another 100 points)

**a. Accuracy**

By default, there is an “aim assist” activated. Turn this off and you’ll realize just how bad of a shot you are. Even though you may kill enemies if you have bad aim with aim assist on and get *some* points, you’ll still only get full points if your aim was close enough to still hit them.

With a maximum of 100 points, the scoring with aim assist on is calculated by “how much aim assist was needed to help you still hit your target?” This means that you can still kill an enemy with a poor shot (with aim assist’s help) and only get a couple points for your accuracy score.

**b. Timing**

Like most rhythm games, timing is extremely important, giving you half of the possible points from a shot. Unlike other rhythm games like Audica that shows exactly where to shoot and when though, you as the player are responsible for who / where to shoot and when.

When you first start playing, if your gun bullets were a percussion instrument, you’d probably get kicked out of the band. Later, you start to wonder why every band doesn’t have a “pistol player.”

**c. Additional info related to timing**

I had to ask the developers for some of these details. Timing is 150ms for each eighth note — 75ms on either side of the beat. The game lets you follow the beat with a shot within an 8th note, regardless of whether it was technically within the on-beat window. This allows for syncopation and 16th notes and allows you to still get creative with making rhythms with your shots.

## 2. Pistol Whips

Pistol Whips are very satisfying to pull off, but can be challenging at the beginning. For those who don’t know, a pistol whip is when you bash an enemy with your gun (think doing a melee hit in Halo)

To pull off a pistol whip, you have to taunt an enemy in front of you to shoot at you, dodge it, then you’ll need to time how long you have before the enemy reloads and tries to shoot you again, taking him out before he does with a swift hit to the face with your gun.

Killing with a Pistol Whip has a velocity counter, so you get max points for a 4m/s floating average. If your swing has less speed, you’ll earn less points, exponentially. Basically, pretend like the enemy is a Beat Saber block and you’ll be good.

**Why exactly would you want to do a pistol whip, it sounds riskier?** It is in some ways, but it has a payoff. Basically, a pistol whip is one of the easiest ways to guarantee maximum points from killing an enemy. Most likely, if you pistol whip a 4-shot-to-kill enemy with a bit of force, you’ll get 800 points (almost guaranteed, as long as you didn’t shoot them yet). If you shoot a 4 hit enemy twice before doing a pistol whip, you’ll only be able to get the leftover full 400 points with the pistol whip.

One last benefit of a pistol whip is that it reloads your gun and restores your full health. You don’t get additional points (beyond what you’d get if you had perfect shots), but the number of pistol whips you did in a level is also recorded for bragging rights at the end of a song.

## 3. Enemy Types

There’s 3 types of enemies in Pistol Whip.

**1 shot to kill baddies** – These give a maximum of 200 points

**2 shots to kill baddies** – These give a maximum of 400 points

**4 shots to kill baddies** – These give up to 800 points (either with a single pistol whip or 4 shots that all hit their target)

## 4. Modifiers

Modifiers are great ways to change up your gameplay and can allow you to get even higher scores if you disable aim assistant (and also have great aim). You can open up the modifier menu to see more about each one of these and how they affect your score. I’ll try to add some more details on that soon here.

So that pretty much sums up the scoring!

A few last FAQ:

## Are there mods and custom maps?

Not yet, but the devs have a lot of ideas for this and said they’ll make an announcement in a couple weeks at what that could possibly look like. A Beat Saber modeler Sir Raynor helped me mod in a new gun and got their full blessing to do so. New songs are entirely possible, but are a little complicated since there’s a whole level custom created around the song. I could still see a few ways this could work well and I’m excited to hear what the devs announce about it in a couple weeks.

Anyway, hope this was helpful. See you on the leaderboards!

Vive,"Vive HMD not displaying anything, SteamVR losing base stations, help please.","Here's what's happening, also, it's normal for the in game HMD position to be that low, since the base stations are moved from where they usually are. Also I'm aware that it's saying base station drivers are out of date, that's because I flashed it to factory drivers while troubleshooting, that's what those 3 things on the desktop are. Also, I only have one base station plugged in in the recording, because it wouldn't have mattered, the same thing happens at the exact same time as the other one: https://streamable.com/kt323

Things I have done during troubleshooting:

* Disconnected then reconnected

* uninstalled/reinstalled USB drivers

* Completely unplugged everything, including from the link box, then uninstalled and reinstalled USB drivers again.

* swapping out the HDMI cable from the link box

* Running Steam and SteamVR as admin

* power cycling the link box

* I tried directly connecting base stations via USB to check for firmware

* Testing it on my spare laptop that has never had steamVR ever installed on it before to see if it was a driver issue on my PC (Same problem on spare laptop)

* Making sure the things were plugged in on both ends

* Restarted PC after USB driver reinstall, several times

* Reinstalling SteamVR

* Switching to SteamVR Beta (and back again after that didn't work)

* Verifying integrity of the tool cache

* Power cycling base stations

* Directly connecting the HDMI to my PC

* Switching to Direct Mode

* Turning off vive camera

* Turning off Bluetooth

* Closing discord

* Uninstalling OpenVR advanced settings

* Deleting steamVR stuff from appdata for a truly fresh reinstall

* Buying an entirely new 3 in 1 cable after troubleshooting it and not getting any display from the old one's HDMI after plugging my spare laptop into a TV (still same problem)

* Connecting my vive directly to the back of my PC with the HDMI and USB on it sans the power connected to the linkbox which is *required* for power supplying

* Swearing a lot in frustration

What perplexes me is that my HMD is tracking for a set amount of time, but no in headset display is happening. The light on my Vive HMD is green till I turn on SteamVR then it's red. My base station top light remains green even after the crash, which means I can't troubleshoot if it's a base station problem since I literally went as far as to flash the firmware back to factory defaults in case there was a corruption happening and that still didn't fix it. What perplexes me even more is that the same exact problem happened on my spare VR ready laptop despite never plugging my headset into it before ever before now, which means it shouldn't be a driver corruption issue on my desktop I don't think. 

Another thing is that even though my controllers that are wireless, they get straight up disconnected in the short period it takes for the SteamVR viewport to cut out. Based on the desktop viewport of SteamVR they tracked just fine before getting kicked out of the system too; The lights on them go from green to blue in about the same time it takes for steamVR to soft crash, and they get disconnected permanently from this. Happened on both my valve index controllers *and* my vive wands.

Chatting to customer service is like non existent and they keep replying "" we are waiting for confirmation from warehouse"". Anyone returned their cosmos ? If so how long did it take to be refunded.

BEWARE: i will stay well clear of that headset . Not only is the product poor, but the customer service is atrocious to say the least. Never again would i buy anything from HTC

EDIT : So 5+  weeks later still waiting and not a single word from customer service. This to me is pure theft as I have returned their product. Next for me is legal action this has to stop and cant keep going like this . if i was the exception then cool .

Vive,Anyone know where to get thin face gaskets?,"Hello fellow Vivers,

I have a Vive Pro and although I swapped out the face gasket for a comfortable PU pleather gasket, I'm interested in getting the best FOV as possible by getting my eyes nice and close to the lenses. I've found that I can crank the tightness right up to get it fairly snug without any headaches but I feel that if the face gasket were thinner yet, I'd be able to crank out a few more degrees FOV.

Can anyone make some recommendations for really skinny gaskets? TIA.",1573131219.0,23,12,129422

Vive,Short Extension - Vive,"Hi Folks,

Currently have my computer in my computer room with my Vive in my VR room with a pass through on the wall to connect my headset. The cords have always been long enough and I’ve had no issues. Recently I’ve moved my computer to the opposite end of my desk and now the HDMI and the USB are about 3 ft too short to reach my computer. What’s the best solution to extending these cables? I’ve read people are using powered cables but that’s usually for much longer extensions ? (25ft extra)  Can I get away with just a regular extender for these cords?",1573190406.0,1,2,129422

Vive,HTC Cosmos: Lighthouse tracking of controllers?,"I have a Vive Cosmos and a Vive (original). Cosmos quality is excellent. Headset tracking is really really good, far better than Windows inside-out tracking - probably due to more cameras.  However, CONTROLLERS are lost on the games that matter (Beat Saber, RecRoom, even SongBeater). It's frustrating to know you hit a block/sphere or tossed a grenade perfectly, per the original, except for Cosmos losing it unless you are inside 50 degrees of center visual.

I know that, in February, the Cosmos will have an additional $200ish add-on for sale that allows the HEADSET to be seen by the Lighthouses, but the REAL need is for the controllers to be seen by lighthouses.

Q: Are there ANY plans, or even hacks, to improve the controllers, even by lighthouse?",1573153022.0,6,23,129422
Vive,Vive Pro wireless - wired; daily conversion solution,"Hey there,

I've been looking for a solution here several times but as the Pistol Whip release is within few hours the issue is highly relevant to me again.

I swallowed the high price of the Vive Pro and then the even higher price (in comparision) for the wireless module plus adapter ( both original HTC). While performance and picture quality is good enough for me for the typical roomscale game, the FPS and picture quality (flickering, artifacts) using wireless while flying Flightsims (DCS etc) was too bad while at the same time wireless isnt really needed. So I converted my HMD back to wired many weeks ago. 

This way I completley stopped playing roomscale games like Blade and Sorcery. However, there must be a solution where I can simply use my Headset in wired more. Power is not the problem. I would even use power bank while video is wired. However, I havent found a cable +  adapter solution for quickly changing to video via HDMI or DP without opening my HMD (it'll break one day).

Any hints?",1573137660.0,11,12,129422

Vive,Modders have once again SAVED Skyrim! 3 essential VR mods...,"For the unaware, some essential modding has resulted in Skyrim VR actually becoming a really decent VR title. I made this video so you can see...

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jap72TIhgDI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jap72TIhgDI)

The video features a full IK player avatar (painfully missing from the original game), allowing you to see yourself in armor (WTF was this missing from the game Bethesda!?!?!), and voice recognition for the real-time selection of spells and dialogue options.

All three of these mods all but eliminate the constant need to pause the game to access GUI elements, destroying your precious IMMERSION!

VRIK PLAYER AVATAR [https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23416](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23416)

The biggest hole in the original game fixed by modders! Providing  incredible immersion to the player by displaying a first person player  avatar that moves in sync with the players movements, with a full  inverse kinematic upper torso. Comes complete with a 3rd person vanity  mode, displays any armor the player chooses to equip, any race or gender  the player chooses to be, and also featuring the ESSENTIAL  FUNCTIONALITY with a 14 slot fully customisable holster system. Store  and retrieve weapons and tools from almost any position on your in game  body!

WAY OF THE VOICE [https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/16379](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/16379)

Allows for the unlocking and selection of any of the vanilla spells  using VOICE RECOGNITION, further freeing you from the immersion-breaking  torture of the Skyrim GUI.

DRAGONBORN SPEAKS NATURALLY [https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/16514](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/16514)

Speak to any NPC in Skyrim with your own voice, participate in the game  like its a MOVIE by READING THE LINES OF THE SCRIPT! This mod knows  which choice you want by voice recognition. As a bonus effect Way Of The  Voice mod also gains from increased responsiveness if you also install  this mod!

So... if you own Skyrim VR I would highly advise you check out these mods and install them... you'd be doing yourself a big favour!

More information can always be found at /r/skyrimvr , thats where I found out!

Thanks! Message me if you need help or have questions! And have fun!

Vive,Battle Dome is still fun to play if you can schedule 10 players,"So we hold a party last night with  around 10 players，we tried to play some popular games like beat saber and Pavlov together but the gap between skill level is so much. 

We have beat saber player who compete on world leaderboard with players who can't finish expert level songs; we have decent Pavlov player with player who are not into shooting game but can beat anyone in tactic games. We can hardly get a balanced PVP game until we tried battle dome.  For co-op games the maxium number I know is Zomday for 8 players.

The game with CTF mode and color map makes every player contribute to its team even if he's not good at shooting. (In color map, player can only teleport to the painted tiles with their team color. Player can paint the block with a paint gun but then they can't use any powerful two handed weapon) We played for 10+ rounds and everyone felt involved.

So, the last time I used vr was on the GEARVR on my old Samsung phone, I never used vr on pc. and I wanted to ask:

1. In general, for 300$, it worth to buy the cosmos even with all the problems (which probably will be fixed in the future, right?)?
2. the problems that everyone talks about is only on games? or it will be effect me even if i will watch a movie?
3. When i watching a movie, can i do that from any distance i want to or i need to stay close to the pc? there is a distance limitations?

This has the potential to be a killer app and best Karaoke app ever because it puts you on stage singing in front of a huge crowd and it's polished and looks good.

But there's one huge flaw...the audio is garbage.  There's no spatial audio or anything which just kills the immersion.  The game is 2 years old so most likely dead but it's so close to greatness that
maybe if we put enough pressure on the devs they will fix it.

I then unplugged all the cables and tested both the HDMI cables on my PS4 to my TV, both cable worked, I can see my PS4 contents displayed on the TV

The Vive Pro would be far more perfect if there was more space for the nose - if i move the googles outside (like for people who use glasses) i get too much tunnel vision and its not really enjoyable.

Hasn't gotten heavy use over the years, but I did have one friend several months back with extremely sweaty hands that killed my other launch controller. This one seemed to be okay.

Vive,Is there a way to hide or disable the IPD?,"Recently my Vive began to have an issue where if I shook my headset with any kind of force, the IPD would show up as if I were turning the knob. I have messed with the knob so I know it's not just on the cusp of two different settings. It seems like it might be a hardware issue with something loose, but it shouldn't be that big of a deal if I can simply hide or disable the popup message.

I have already tried going to the 'ipdvalue.css' file and editing as many old posts mention as a solution, but there are a couple of weird things.

1. That file didn't exist until I made it, using this link's version of the file: [GitHub](https://gist.github.com/deprecatedcoder/74e65d0d320976f500c533401e9d51a5)
2. Nothing happened when I put it into what I believe is the right spot:  
C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\SteamVR\\content\\panorama\\styles

Does anyone have any ideas on how to fix this? None of the changes I make in that file have any affect on the IPD when it pops up. It's making games pretty much unplayable.

SOLUTION: Courtesy of /r/elvissteinjr

Navigate to: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\SteamVR\resources\webinterface\dashboard\css\systemui.css

Find '.IPDParent' and add: 'display: none;' to it. And that's all there is to it!",1572996106.0,6,19,129422

If anyone is looking at this you have to go into your stream config folder and delete steamvr.vrsettings whole SteamVR is not running. (I’d make a backup somewhere just in case things get screwed up)

Start StramVR and it should reset everything. The only thing is that all your settings including base station power management and controller bindings will get re-set. So make sure you save your controller bindings and remember what your settings are before you do this.

Is it normal to have CPU frame times over 14 Ms on Project Cars 2, for example, even while CPU load is at 40-60% according to fpsVR? It feels like I'm getting performance issues in games despite there apparently being room for the CPU to work harder.

My BIOS settings seem fine, as all the values it detects are accurate, and everything is set to auto. GPU driver is updated. I have no idea what's going wrong. I shouldn't have issues holding 90 fps on a Vive.

Vive,Occasional tracking issues with Index controllers?,"I use lighthouses 1.0, a Pimax 5K+ and Index (Indices?) controllers.

I never had a single tracking problem with Vive wands, 5-stars 100% perfect across the board even on Beat Saber Expert+. Index controllers work fine *for a while*, then eventually become erratic for... a random amount of time.

I used to use Windows 7 and could not install the latest PiTools, but I eventually bit the bullet and downgraded to Windows 10 on a separate HD just to test this. I was thus able to install latest version (1.0.0.180).

The situation improved, but it's not 100% perfect yet. I played Surv1v3 for about an hour, and after about 30 minutes the tracking became so erratic I could not hold a weapon in both hands; going back to the menu and selecting another game mode somehow fixed it.

**QUESTION**

Does anyone else has tracking with Index controllers but not with Vive wands? Is there any way at all to troubleshoot this?

At this point, I suspect that the Pimax headset itself, and more precisely the bluetooth bandwidth with the controllers, could be the reason of this problem.",1572951355.0,4,0,129422

VR E-Sports is missing competitive MOBA games and Cradle of Sins is aspiring to be one. From the early days of developing, we have been working with competing VR gamers who are also taking part in our Alpha testing in order to help shape the game. 

We wish to bring Something that is polished and has a proven track record – a good game that people want to play and will keep playing after weeks of release. We have approached the game with a community first mentality. This has proven successful as we continuously receive constructive feedback from our closed Discord group. They truly have helped us shape the game into what it is today. 

We're about to release the **Official Gameplay trailer** in a couple of days. Made by David Williams (ddubb) and soundtrack composed by an award winning film composer Simone Cilio.

We've recently upgraded our Vive Pro with the wireless kit. So far connection and framerate and picture-quality are as advertised and there's no difference to a wired Vive Pro.

Vive,"None of my ""extra"" dashboard tabs (Advanced Settings, Revive, and Viveport) work anymore.","It's been a few days since I last tried using any of them. I've been doing dev work, so I disabled the chaperone. I'm testing out a new video card I got recently, and tried to disable the chaperone, only to find that the tab is empty. Uninstalling and reinstalling didn't help.

I was ultimately able to re-enable the chaperone by editing steamvr.vrsettings in the Steam install directory and setting CollisionBoundsFadeDistance back to 0.7, which seems to be the default, but I still have the problem of the 3 tabs being empty.

The only thing that's different on my PC since the last time I tried using those tabs is the video card I installed earlier today. It only has 1 HDMI port, so I gave it to the Vive, since I don't have any DisplayPort adapters. I plugged both of my monitors into the motherboard to use the integrated graphics card.

I have a DisplayPort to HDMI cable arriving in a few days, so I'll know for sure if that's the problem, but is there anything else I might be able to do to get these tabs to work, if that isn't the solution? It seems pretty odd for 3rd-party SteamVR dashboard tabs not to work if there are no monitors plugged into the discrete graphics card.

Edit: I tried playing Project Cars 2. The game refused to display in VR. When I started a race, I could look at the game responding to the headset's motion, but the VR view wouldn't actually show up in the headset, and I saw a warning pop up on the SteamVR app saying to plug the headset into the same video card as the primary monitor.

H3VR doesn't have this problem, though, so... bad programming?

Edit 2: fpsVR's tab works fine, also. I'm really thinking this has something to do with some code trying to target a specific GPU or display somehow, and getting screwy when the assumption that the monitor and headset are plugged into the same card turns out to be false. I'll find out when I get an adapter tomorrow.

Edit 3: Plugging my main monitor into the same GPU as the headset, rather than the motherboard, by using an HDMI to Display port adapter fixed all the empty tabs as well as PCars 1 and 2. I don't understand it, but I accept it.",1572852986.0,19,9,129422

Vive,Any OBS tips for VR streaming setup? (Want to avoid frame skipping lag),"So I have my non-vr setup dialed in pretty well so that it doesn't frameskip (Different from dropping frames or lagging) by keeping about 5% of the GPU overhead available to OBS at any given time when streaming. I'm worried that moving to VR is going to tank the GPU though, and assuming I'll need to redo my setup to get decent quality. Here's where I'm currently at:

* Ryzen 1700x OC'd to 3.7ghz
* 1060 6gb OC'd to \~2115 GPU core &amp; \~4680 Mem Clock

SLOBS (Streamlabs obs ) @:

* Base canvas size 1080
* Scaled output 720 bicubic
* 48fps
* x264 CBR 4000 bitrate
* Cpu preset faster
* x264 options opencl=true
* Recording x264, cbr 8000, veryfast, nonscaled
* Slobs set at high priority cpu process

Now, I ***do*** have a vega 64, but I need to RMA it and get a 2060 super or a 5700 xt because it has some serious throttling problems at low resolutions and won't undervolt correctly. (Check my post history if you want to learn more.) So for now, that option is out.

Things I think I can do:

1. Switch to NVEC as the primary encoder to force SLOBS to prioritize the gpu before the game eats it up.
2. Change my x264 preset to veryfast

Things I'm afraid I might have to:

1. Switch to Regular OBS to free up some processor resources bc slobs is hungry
2. Drop the resolution of my local recordings
3. Change my canvas size
4. Edit: I forgot about the option [from my last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Vive/comments/9wgwni/twitch_streaming_problems_with_1060_i53570_slobs/) of using a second rig. I still have my i5 + 970 from last year laying around.
5. Edit 2: ~~Another crazy option - I could put the vega in the second pcie8x slot and dedicated to encoding?~~ I'm told this doesn't work.

Vive,Hey! Question about the wireless power bank!,"So I love my wireless Vive. It was so easy to setup and looks great, though admittedly my Rift S had a nicer display. Anyways, I've been looking into a solution for the low battery life. The issue I'm running into is that I have a 3D Printed holder that I bought that only fits batteries of the official sized ones. So I'm looking for something that is bigger in capacity but the same size as the original battery. Was wondering if anyone had found anything similar that would work. 

I understand it needs to be QC 3.0 to actually work with the Wireless adapter and so far, this is the best option I've found even though it's a bit pricy: [https://www.amazon.com/Grapheme-Wireless-Portable-20000mAh-High-Speed/dp/B07Y9S4WCY/ref=sr\_1\_12\_sspa?keywords=QC+3.0+power+bank&amp;qid=1572788852&amp;sr=8-12-spons&amp;psc=1&amp;spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEyU0w0NlM0SDhLWDFNJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwNjk3NzE3NjdPNkNCTE8yVDROJmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTAxNTg2NDMxNUJPUU5IVDQ2T1dVJndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfbXRmJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ==](https://www.amazon.com/Grapheme-Wireless-Portable-20000mAh-High-Speed/dp/B07Y9S4WCY/ref=sr_1_12_sspa?keywords=QC+3.0+power+bank&amp;qid=1572788852&amp;sr=8-12-spons&amp;psc=1&amp;spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEyU0w0NlM0SDhLWDFNJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwNjk3NzE3NjdPNkNCTE8yVDROJmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTAxNTg2NDMxNUJPUU5IVDQ2T1dVJndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfbXRmJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ==)

Vive,Play all retro games in VR,"Hi guys,

Some of you might see this as old news but only recently i found this and i guess that not everyone here found it already so i'd like to help you guys with how to get EmuVR. It's free btw.

 [http://www.emuvr.net/](http://www.emuvr.net/)  On the website are instruction to get to the download.

You can play all retro consoles on several old tv's, even old dos games, psx and much more. Just like in real life you have to connect the cables, plug in the game cassette or cd's, press the ON buttons, ... You can decorate your room with custom posters, wallpapers, floors, bedsheet, you can even add the pictures/logo's on the cassettes/cd's. It's really cool if you're a fan of retro games.

If you wanna figure out how to get everything working in emuvr i suggest you'd watch these short video's in the developer's playlist  [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLl8MHzvg8QAIALb8WNz-3ttdKfkMiBp-L](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLl8MHzvg8QAIALb8WNz-3ttdKfkMiBp-L) 

It took me quiet some time to put all the pictures on each cassette ect but here is my room in case you wanna see how my virtual room looks like :D [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=075FKPRMfTc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=075FKPRMfTc)

Vive,[Help!] Trackpad (not click related) registers constant touch.,"On one of my controllers, the trackpad registers a constant touch in the 10 o’clock position without my thumb touching it. It clicks down absolutely fine and any other input on the trackpad over rights it. In the SteamVR menu, where you can see you controller, there is a definite dot indicator on the trackpad in the same position.

Resetting the controller fixes problem for a few minutes then will come back a while after. Very annoying in games like Pavlov where it snaps direction and I end up spinning around in circles until I vomit onto my carpet.

Vive,Oculus Rift CV1 vs HTC Vive used?,"

So I really want to get into VR, and im thinking about getting a used rift or vive.
What do you guys suggest? I have never experienced vr before, should I get the rift or the vive? And what is a good price for it? Currently they seem to be going for around £450-499 new.
I found a used rift CV1 (marvel edition) for £180, and most of the used vives are around £200-300.

Thoughts?

Vive,HTC Vive Pre?,"Hi All,

Is there any functional difference between the HTC Vive and HTC Vive Pre? I found a really cheap HTC Vive on facebook marketplace (only 200$), the only difference I noticed between a regular Vive and this headset was the different power plugs, as these had european ones. The seller said he got it as a present from work 2 years ago, but never used it, and if I have any problem with it, he will take it back.

I bought it and brought it home now, and I noticed an HTC VIVE PRE label on the controllers. After a little googling, the only things I found out about the Pre are that they were made a few months before the regular ones for developers, but has the exact same specs as the regular vive. The headset and controllers really look like they were never used before, the base stations even have the foils still on, and there are some unopened bags with cables in the box. If this is functionally the same as a regular Vive, I would like to keep it, as I don't think I could get anything as good as this for a similar price. 

Do you know, if the base stations and controllers for the Pre are working same as the regular Vive? So can I upgrade to a Vive Pro or Pimax headset later, without needing to buy a pair of new base stations and controllers too?",1572656343.0,6,6,129422

However, after the setup downloads software and a setup guide (which is about as big as the software itself, smh), I get the following error:""Close Steam""""Confirm that you've closed the Steam client, and then click ""Continue"".

Steam is closed, nothing in the taskbar, nothing in task manager even when expanded to show all tasks.

As an extra precaution, I tried closing all Oculus software, Viveport, and a bunch of other things, but the message persists and whenever I click ""Continue"" it just comes back.

I tried restarting, I tried reinstalling Viveport, I even tried changing the name of my Steam folder in which SteamVR is already installed, so that setup would not be able to find any files (and presumably do a clean install), but it still gives the same error.

I spoke to a friend who had the same issue, even tried it on a machine on which Steam had never been installed, and he still got the error, but after a few days it went away and he could finally use the headset.

Vive,I bought my vive pro back after 3 months struggle with Index,"I sold my vive pro after I receive my index full set, I really like its controller(which made most revive games not only playable but enjoyable) and the audio is much more stable, no need to play with microphone or headphone setting in steamvr anymore. 

But, the LCD screen is a nightmare as I played Skyrim and Beat Saber most of the time. Black level is terrible no matter how I adjust brightness in steamvr setting. It makes everything unreal and blurry in certain games.  When I bought Index I thought it will only affect visual quality in some dark scene, but in reality even my steamvr home is quite blurry and washed out, Beat Saber felt even worse than my Quest. I thought I will get used to it someday since it did slightly improved visual quality in apps like Pavlov and virtual desktop, but I didn't. I almost burst into tear when I switch back to OLED screen yesterday.  It seems that when supersampling is higher than 1.5 on a 3K screen, the black level is more important than 50% extra subpixels provided by LCD screen. Although I have to admit that I didn't take advantage of Index's 120 Hz flash rate because I can only run my modded SkyrimVR at 90fps The Havok value has to be changed for 120Hz and it causes trouble. Also even with a 2080Ti graphic card and 8700K CPU, you cannot supersampling in most games while running at 120Hz refresh rate. If steamvr could have an option to run apps in different refresh rate, I may use 120Hz in some well optimized games like Superhot or Beat Saber.

I have a friend who also upgrade from Pro to Index, he's using a GTX1080(Supersampling at 1.1 at 90hz) and prefer to play shooting games like Pavlov. For him the Index is an upgrade on every aspects, whether is audio or visual quality. So it really depend on the game you play.

I will still keep my Index for local multiplayer on a second desktop (goodbye my old rift), but I will use Pro as my main headset at the moment.",1572568415.0,14,27,129422
Vive,HTC Vive - Single / Screen issue's [ Green 1 - 4 Pixels Sparkles / Green 1- 2 pixel wide lines / Flashing white with other colors ],"&amp;#x200B;

\- Ok let's start ( Problems/issues that are happening )

1. Green pixels sparkles popping up randomly around the screen ( Also might look like they are white ) ( Each one comes and goes with in less than a second ) their can be many of these or their can be very few of these
2. Thin Green line appearing near the middle of both screens leaving within less than a second happening way less often as the green sparkles do
3. Bottom part or full screen turn mostly white/ mixed a couple other coloured pixels ( most likely the game single still getting thru a little ) This last less than a second but can happen a couple of times in a row really fast and is not always their
4. Screen wicks out like your going cross eyed ( Stays like this intel you restart the headset ( turning off and turning back on steam Vr )

\------------------------------------------------------

Things that I have tried

* Unplugging and replugging all the cables ( HDMI, Power , USB ) have unplugged all and replugged all making sure they are clean - **No results**
* Checked cable for knots or damage that is visible - **Nothing**
* Made sure all connections are in good - **Nothing**
* Turning steam vr direct view mode off - **Stops number 3. from happening also mostly stoped green spakles and lines but not always**

Other notes all these problems are fixed or at least for the time By keeping SteamVr direct view mode turned off also ( maybe from the headset being warm( Thinking maybe the cold weather is acting it up room get really cold )) also when the cable is elevated ( Cable management ) Not sure going to try again

Problem Started 10/29/2019 - Came when playing Vrchat and got it to go away again 45 mins later and worked for the rest of the night

Problem continuous 10/30/2019 - Turned on problem is still their did testing to figure out what the issue is got it to go away with the stuff above - later tested turning Direct view mode back on did the same thing turned it back off it stopped

11/1/2019 Going to do more test maybe also buying a replacement 3 in 1 cable

\-------------------------------------

From what i have found and looked up over the internet, it seems like the 3 in 1 cable has a lot of issues ( did not know about this until I started researching a lot ) Something to do with the hdmi cable itself not being able to support it anymore and it has lost a single one of the hdmi line ( don't know what they are called ) so im going to buy a new 3 in 1 cable and also do further testing and update this more once the 3 in 1 cable comes i will test it and update and say if it fixed it or not

Ps. The problem happens in steam vr and other games also ( Pavlov , steam Vr , Vrchat ) for testing all do it again seems like a single issue or software issue

Vive,"Tea For God, new build (0.4.0)","Hi guys!

Finally, the first update that introduces new stuff to the gameplay. Following updates should be more often and probably I will be posting short videos with them (similar to the one that is posted here).

[First, check the video with the features.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRhpLvWiegc)

What's new?

Extension modules. These are the things you will be unlocking, finding and putting on your forearms to get better stats, more features, etc. Some of them will be just straight-forward upgrades. Some will upgrade one thing but will have side effects on others. Some will be more convenient but will take more place. For now, there is just a bunch that shows different types of EXMs. It is still a quite few of them and you may find filters on the left side useful. They don't look amazingly detailed but having a colour code for them and making it easier to read them without checking info was the priority. Boosters are round, active EXMs are grey, reactor is yellow, health is red and so on.

In this version, all EXMs are unlocked but soon I will be working on a persistence layer. But more on that later.

Extension modules fall into a few categories:

* boosters - they just improve stats
* passive - for now, this is just navigation and energy pulling (although energy pulling requires input). One of the things I want to add is ""auto-convert"" that will turn any nearby NPC that can be converted into your ally.
* active - here is where the most fun is as you use them during the game. You have to select them by pointing at them with your finger and then you activate with a button press.

And here's a short story behind one active EXM. There were a few people who said that Tea For God reminds them of Another World. I thought why shouldn't I add a shield that works in a very similar way to Another World's shield? So there it is (A/SHLD-S).

There are just five active EXMs now and as it comes to the functionality, these are just three types: attractor, deflector, shield. The attractor is useful to get the enemy's attention (or your robodog). The deflectors may render you untouchable. All incoming energy projectiles are deflected - they turn to not hit you. There are two deflectors: long-range and short-range. And finally, two shields. One that is bound to your hand, and other that you may place anywhere.

No, there is no tutorial but as soon as I feel that the core gameplay mechanisms are complete, I'd like to add some tutorial levels. With the final game, I am still considering whether to add tutorials into the game (which is good because you learn on the way, but bad because it may be distracting and you may not pay attention) or add them as something suggested when you die (then, the game would have to know what to suggest and why). The advantage of the latter is that you may experiment in the tutorials and learn stuff without any distractions around. One thing I am sure, I don't want to explain stuff with text - I'd like to get rid of ""learn basics"" as soon as possible.

There are so many things I'd love to throw into the game right now. I have dozens of ideas for levels, enemies, EXMs, weapon types, features (puzzle machines, the persistence layer which will include a few mini-games on its own). But I want to focus on the core gameplay and the content will have to wait a bit.

Oh, a word about the video. There is no commentary and it may seem to be rushed, especially in the first part. I just didn't want it to drag for too long. There are just glimpses of functionality and very short explanations with some of the stuff to discover on your own (like hot-cold navigation which I prefer). The video was taken using Vive (with tpcast) and Oculus Rift. With PCVR I added extra info on the screen (that was mostly to change the aspect ratio of the main view. But works nicely as a more inside view into the energy levels etc. Actually, I am now thinking about allowing someone else to sit at the keyboard to allow manipulating stuff (selecting EXMs, transferring energy, changing navigation targets (because that will be coming!)). This will alter your loadout as you may not require transfer buttons on your forearms and may have more stuff. Added that to todo list. Asymetric coop.

What else?

Have fun and let me know what you like, what you don't like, what would you like to have in the game.",1572271438.0,51,7,129422
Vive,Vive crashing since today,"For some reason launching SteamVR causes my PC to crash when my Vive is connected since this morning.

Vive,Updated reviews on prescription lens adapters?,"Hey folks.  Recently picked up a Vive and while it's manageable to wear my glasses while I play, it's not an ideal long gaming solution as I find the glasses occasionally get pushed into my eye and smudge.  I'd much rather go with one of the prescription lens adapter solutions that are out there.

Big question is, which one?  I've seen VR Lens Lab, vr-lens.eu, and WIDMOvr all reviewed and talked about, but nothing within the last year or two.  Curious to know how all 3 of these companies have adjusted to the reviews they've gotten and how they stack up against each other now.

Vive,Indie developed Monster Hunting VR Roguelike Game coming to Steam on October 30th - Monster Reapers VR,"Hey Everyone.

We're a two man indie developer team which has been working on a Monster Hunting VR Roguelike called Monster Reapers VR for a while now and it's about to release on steam early access.  
We started out wanting to make a game similar to Luigis Mansion, but we soon recognized even though the mechanics are fun, it wasn't enough to make a game that will be engaging for a long time.  
We started implementing Roguelike and dungeon crawling elements to make it more diverse and also spiced up the combat by adding new weapons and abilities.  
One hand will be your weapon hand and the other hand uses magic. It is heavily inspired by bioshock and we plan on also adding ways to use the elements to interact with environments and such.

Vive,Quality of Life Improvements.,"I'm slowly improving my Vive quality of life.  I've fixed several issues like my cable wrapping around itself in use, but I can't think of any way to make the Vive fit better.

I've adjusted the head piece as the instructions say and the Vive sits well on most slow gameplay, but game where I'm ducking or making fast movements the headset begins to slip and fall.

I'm funding myself throwing a hand up to reset the headset in place several times a song in beat saber and it's beginning to be a major annoyance and potential hazard to the system.  I'm assuming the cause is the back strap sitting at the back top of my head while worn instead of lower down like most masks.

I’ve been wondering if I could use a thunderbolt connection for the problem, but still not sure how. Any advice would be appreciated.",1572334694.0,1,4,129422

Vive,DETAILED GUIDE: Half-Life 2 Campaign in VR (via Garry's Mod),"**Introduction:** 

* Recently I played through Lambda1VR (HL1) on Quest, and loved it. As soon as I finished, I wanted to continue in to HL2. This was the best method I found, and I’m happy to say that I **loved** it! It was a fantastic, epic experience, even with all the technical and configuration challenges. 
* Would highly recommend it to any serious fans. Turns out the gravity gun is pretty fun in VR – who knew. 
* I probably spent about 12-15 hours in the campaign, and another 5 or so hours messing around with stuff to get it working. 
* This guide is intended to reduce the time you spend messing around, so that you can get more time in the game and complete Half-Life 2 completely in Virtual Reality. 

**Requirements:** 

* Garry’s Mod + HL2 in Steam – Garry’s Mod was a cheap $12 for me, though I have no interest in it other than for this application. 
* VR Legs / Iron Stomach – I don’t ever feel sick, but there are some moments here that will **test you**. The airboat is the biggest offender by far, but I think there may have been a few other moments that I can’t specifically recall – **be cautious if you are prone to sickness, and consider leaving this for when your VR legs improve.**
* Patience – The game plays through from start to finish more or less perfectly, but this is an enthusiast/diehard experience and completely unfit for people who aren’t willing to roll their sleeves up. 

**How to Install / Play:**

1. Make sure you have Half-Life 2 and Garry’s Mod installed on Steam.
2. Navigate to the Workshop for Garry’s Mod and install “VRMod - Experimental Virtual Reality” and “Half-Life 2 Campaign Content” mods. (note: I’m not sure if the campaign content mod is strictly necessary).
3. Enable DSR Super-Sampling through your [NVIDIA Control Panel 3d Settings](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/dynamic-super-resolution-instantly-improves-your-games-with-4k-quality-graphics/) (DSR Factors – might as well click ‘em all as far as I can tell – this allows supersampling)
4. Launch Steam VR.
5. Launch Garry’s Mod (you will get a warning, disregard)
6. Increase the resolution in the Garry’s Mod Video menu. SteamVR resolution settings do not work – you must change them manually (how high you go depends on your video card. On a 1080Ti, I used 3325 horizontal.)
7. Start a new game and select HL2 from the options. 
8. If you are starting for the first time, choose d1\_trainstation\_01 – they are NOT in correct order, rather they are alphabetical. If you want pick up where you’ve left off, you can find the correct map order [**here**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Vive/Point%20Insertion)**.** (Note: it can be difficult to make out the text at very high resolutions, so you might want to get a feel for where your map is prior to increasing resolution). 
9. Choose start game. You will spawn with all the appropriate weapons for that map in the game, typically with a full clip and one extra per weapon. 
10. To activate VR, hold down **“Q”** on the keyboard – this will open the Garry’s Mod VR in-game menu. Navigate to the **“utilities”** section, and the “**VRMod”** entry will be at the bottom of the list. 
11. Make sure you check “Automatically load VR when you start a new map” (towards the bottom) so that you can skip this step in future sessions. You can also select HMD/Controller oriented movement, as well as a few others. Avoid the ‘world models’ for wepaons, they don’t work right. 
12. Click “Start VR” and enjoy Half-Life 2. 

I used the following [youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjmN9wt7h5Q&amp;feature=emb_title) to get myself started, so props to them and please consider viewing it if you are having trouble with any of the above steps. 

**There is NO Saving, so what happens when I die/quit?** 

if you die, you have two or three options, depending. 

1. **Restart:** If you really care about not cheating, the best bet is usually to fully exit gmod and restart at the beginning of whichever map you died on. Each map is relatively short, and this isn’t a significant problem. Just be cautious, take things slowly/seriously and you’ll be fine. You will lose your ammo as a penalty for death, but you are given enough at the start of the map to be able to make it comfortably. This can be a pain, but reloading the map without restarting often seems to break things (or did for me). 
2. **Respawn:** You can also respawn, but you will respawn in that same instance - with all the NPCs who were dead, still dead, etc. If a door opened in the beginning of the map, but is now closed, you might be barred from going through. You can noclip through and usually be fine though. If you want to emulate 'checkpoint saving' and dont care too much about the purity of your run, this is probably the simplest option to advance in the game. You will spawn without weapons, and so either need to pick them up in the map, or give them to yourself through the “Q” menu in Garry’s Mod. 
3. **Kill Key NPC:** Finally, if you happen to be accompanied by an important NPC, their death will be game over. When you respawn, this will be a clean level load for some reason and everything will work. So if something glitches and you want to start fresh, just kill Barney or Alyx with a combine ball, which is the most effective immediate KO. 

**Setting Up Controls:**

* Many of the default controls assume you are playing Garry’s Mod, and so the mapping can be improved. I used Vive Wands, and used this  [layout](https://imgur.com/a/BEPMzpH) , you can download my [SteamVR Input export](http://s000.tinyupload.com/index.php?file_id=23776465543963730812). It was also saved in the community bindings, but I have not been able to access those recently. Further note, I think my controls could be further improved for sure, so if anyone works on a better default, I will post theirs here. 
* If you’re using other controllers, my export isn’t working for you, and you’re not already familiar with SteamVR Input mapping, this is a good time to get your feet wet. You can basically rebind everything to your liking. 
* One input that is valuable for troubleshooting is the Garry’s Mod “Q” Menu. This is a menu that you want occasionally, but don’t need quick access to. I created a chord (left menu, left grip) to open this menu in the Steam Input Settings. 

**Control Tips:**

* **Using objects:** To “use” something, the 'action point' that determines whether you can activate something is at the end of the right hand - but not just the hand, its the model. If you have the empty hands/crowbar etc, the action point becomes the centre of your HMD. 
* **Flashlight:** Your flashlight will come out of your right hand as well. You will notice *significant* performance drops when the flashlight is on in some environments. I’m sure this can be tweaked or modified in the video settings. 
* **Aiming Melee/Grenades**: To aim crowbars and grenades, use your HMD - not your right hand. Don’t know why this is the case, but it is. The centre of the flashlight can help you to aim the crowbar. 
* **Aiming Guns:** For some guns, the iron sights are somewhat workable (i.e. pistol), on others (i.e. SMG) they’re not reliable. The combine gun doesn’t even have sights! Consider this a flavor-win…if you just picked up an alien gun, maybe it wouldn’t be setup with your ease of use in mind. That said, I found a consistent way to sight even the combine gun, and I’m sure you can too!
* **Who you talkin’ to?:** You may notice some of the NPC’s staring at the floor when they talk to you – that’s because they are talking to the end of your gun/right hand. You can solve this by either switching to empty hands/crowbar etc, or holding your gun’s barrel to your own face – or, as many of the game’s quirks, by ignoring and accepting this defect. 
* **Weapon Wheel:** If you're not familiar with the weapon wheel, it works by scrolling clockwise or counterclockwise to advance. It's not the best for large inventories, but honestly by the end I didn’t mind it. 
* **Ladders:** OK, so ladders seem crazy and almost made me tear my hair out – but actually, they work fine. also ladders are crazy. you will think they are incredibly broken and janky, but heres the process: you walk up and get your right hand in the proper distance to activate (if the activation point goes through the ladder, it wont work. Usually you can be pretty far from things, so err on the side of being farther away. AFTER YOU ACTIVATE THE LADDER, put both your hands in the air above your head.  You probably only need one of them, probbaly the right hand, or it might even be controller orientation,  but I always put my hands up and it worked everytime. To get off the ladder, 'use' it again. you'll almost always pop on to whatever surface you need to. 
* **Vehicles:** The Vehicles use their own separate bindings, and for the most part they work fine – but keep in mind, the mounted weapons are completely, irreparably broken. Do not bother trying to fix them, you can’t. The mounted weapon seems to have a fixed relative orientation. I.e. it’s relative to the world, not to you or your controllers. Also like three different inputs have an influence in the way they aim. I actually managed to defeat the helicopter in the airboat despite this, but It basically meant that you always had to attack from the same direction – hard to explain, but the long-story short is: forget about them and don’t waste two hours of your life like I did. 
* **Q Menu:** The “Q” Menu in Garry’s Mod allows you to give yourself weapons, change settings in the VRmod, and spawn items/objects. This can occasionally be useful to get around glitchy areas, give yourself a weapon after respawning, or others. 

**Places you** ***will*** **get stuck (spoilers):** 

There are several sections that are outright broken and require workarounds, but luckily I have already figured them all out for you. Here they are in order of appearance:

* **The Water Trap:** During the d1\_canals\_01a you will be going through a long tunnel when you will find a pool of water. It can be difficult to get out of this and continue on. I would guess that most people who brave this mod and quit, quit here. I spawned some extra boxes and pallets, and then used those to help me jump up. I think that if you ‘raise your arms’ above your head while you try to get out, it might work for the same reason it works on ladders. Last resort, open the console and ‘noclip’ to get up. 
* **Vehicle Combat:** The gun doesn’t reliably work on the airboat or the car. During **Route Kanal** you will need to destroy an attack helicopter. Just spawn yourself an RPG with the “Q” Menu. It is possible to kill it with the gun (I did it) but in retrospect I wish I had just cheated my way through. You never need the gun on the buggy, so just ignore it. 
* **Ravenholm:** d1\_town\_03 is actually several maps and I believe is the only instance in which you will ‘load’ into the same map, and not the next one. This confused me the first time. This makes it annoying as you have to do all the sections in one go (or else clip/cheat through). If you do decide to respawn/cheat through to get to your old position, you will have to trigger all the scenes with the old man who helps you, as the level will not progress if the scenes have not triggered. 
* **Alyx in City 17:** The map d3\_citadel\_6b, where you meet back up with Alyx, has messed up spawns. If you load in from the previous level, and don’t die during this chapter, then you won’t even notice. But if you start directly from this map, or if you try to respawn in any way, you will definitely notice. It seems to be spawning randomly (multiplayer spawns???) and you will have to noclip back to the very beginning of the level, and then proceed normally to trigger the cutscene with Alyx and continue from there. 
* **Super Gravity Gun:** When you load into d3\_citadel\_03, you will be stripped of your weapons but you will not receive the super gravity gun. You need to download an addon to get it then give it to yourself in the “Q” menu.  You might find that your aim is now attached to your HMD – this is because the gun will take its Aim orientation from whichever weapon you had last (i.e. HMD if crowbar/hands/grenades, Right hand if gun). So if you switch to it from the machine gun (should be able to find one on the first combines or in Q menu) it will go back to normal. You will also find that your gun model might now be screwed up – no fix for this that I’m aware of, but it won’t impact gameplay. I don’t recommend installing this addon until later, as it will clutter up your menu and can screw up gun models when it’s not necessary. 
* **Episode 1 / Episode 2:** They just don’t work. Sorry. I ended up playing them flat. Was disappointing! If anyone does know how to get them working for a full playthrough, please let me know!!!

Apologies if there are any errors (which I'm sure there are at least a couple). I will update to incorporate corrections/suggestions/better tips/etc as they come in from the comments.

In the meantime, for all the brave souls who choose to take on the Combine in City 17 - good luck",1575926331.0,148,21,129422

Vive,Highly recommend Onward for anyone who plays Pavlov and Contractors,"Just a headsup because I know a lot of people who play VR shooters don't play more than 1-2 games regularly, and I think a lot of people would like this. 

Onward, for those who don't know, is the most realistic shooter in VR and one of the big three (Pavlov, Onward, Contractors). The Devs are very intent on it being a realistic MilSim so you're not going to get TTT or anything too comical (although it does have RPGs, Drones, C4, and stun guns). But it also means the game's tension, gunplay, and personal physics are unmatched. The primary mode is based on search and destroy so you don't respawn, and the game is all about positioning, directional audio, and flanking. There are more guns and attachments and there are dedicated classes, and sniper mechanics are better with both aim and scope smoothing that reduces tracking and hand jitter without making the game too easy. There are side sights and hybrid scopes, and the game makes you balance your loadout points between different attachments, body armor, grenades, or pistols.

You can definitely play both this and Pavlov or Contractors, but if you play Pavlov and prefer playing pure combat modes like Search and Destroy then Onward is perfect for you. I played over 200 hours of Pavlov but Onward just feels a lot better for pure combat modes and no weapons feel OP or terrible. Maps are huge and spotting enemies and figuring out their spawn is a big part of it, which also makes sniper rifles really viable. When you compare just combat and gunplay Onward feels like Pavlov 2.0, even if it is less forgiving. I also do a lot more crouching and evading in this.

Onward has modded maps (no rules or mode mods), although because it was sold on the Oculus store as well they don't use steam workshop. This means mods are little bit of a pain to download right now but the game doesn't lean on mods as much as pavlov. Onward also has other modes like Gun Game, One in the Chamber, and Spec Ops, but those are only available in private lobbies if they aren't the ""social mode"" of the month. It also has higher hardware requirements but the graphics look better in my view, and things like lighting and shadows look better with very little text when you're in combat that distracts you by becoming pixelated at a distance. It has a single player/co op mode where you hunt or escape AI who are really hard, maybe too hard.

It gets updated a fair amount, new custom maps come out steadily, etc. A quest version is reportedly on the way but I have no idea how that will be. There is a dedicated community and around ten lobbies even after midnight, with a lot of Pacific and European players, and a recent sale boosted player numbers a lot.",1575888262.0,93,107,129422
Vive,Vive FOV Values: For Unity Shader (s),"Heya brothers and sisters! First time poster, long time lurker.

While working on a shader I needed the horizontal and vertical FOV values; the search lead me here.
I found a thread where people were looking for the same, but there was no answer, so I dug into Unity and found the internal values.

Horizonal FOV: 106.0971
Vertical FOV: 111.7577

Vive,Gorillaz Inspired VR Experience in Development - Help Us Bring it to Life!,"Hi, I'm Jake. I'm a VR developer from Sydney, Australia. Earlier this year I released my first music VR project INTERSTELLA VR - A Daft Punk inspired experience. Watch the video or download it here: [jakedonaldsonvr.com/interstellavr](http://jakedonaldsonvr.com/interstellavr).

It created waves on the internet and received a lot of media attention, including articles from [Road To VR](https://www.roadtovr.com/daft-punk-vr-one-more-time-fan/), [EDM.com](https://edm.com/news/daft-punk-vr), and [DJ Mag](https://djmag.com/news/daft-punk%E2%80%99s-%E2%80%98one-more-time%E2%80%99-has-been-turned-vr-rave-watch).

Next I'm looking to produce a no-budget **GORILLAZ** inspired VR project based on the music video for [FEEL GOOD INC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyHNuVaZJ-k). It will be an immersive, interactive experience to be played on 6DOF headsets, like Vive, Rift and (potentially) Quest.

Vive,VR Game Idea (Nowhere else to post?),"Hey, Recently I was quite bored. So I wrote up an entire VR game plot in 2 hours. Don't you just hate it when you write a game, I do. Anyway, my game ""idea"" is called Cube-ustry (Mashup of cube, and industry, corny I know.)

Quick run-down
You start in a white void, infront of you is a gray desk, and three cube shaped holes, (Each hole had a colored sticker next to it. Red, Green, and Blue.) behind you is a chute/dispenser that appears to stretch into infinity.

""Hello"" the narrator greets.

""Welcome to your workplace, please state your name out loud.""

*Player presumably says name*

""Just kidding, I don't actually care. Your Employee #002.""

*Fax machine like sound plays from behind you, as a red cube falls out*

""Please grab the RED Cube and place it into the RED slot.""

Two events will trigger base on different reactions

*If player puts the cube in the red slot* (String 1)

""Good Good, You got this.""

*Fax like sound plays again, a green cube falls out this time. You get prompted with the same message as before""

""Please grab the GREEN Cube and place it into the GREEN slot.""

*if player puts it in*

""Great! You've got the hang of things, i'm sure you can figure the next thing out.""

*Fax Sound plays, once again. And a blue cube falls out of the chute, and the narrator says nothing.*

That is the main story, here is an additional part. 


*If player doesn't do as asked, for any cube insertion*
(StringF)

""As I said, put the (cubenamewillvaluebasedonevent) cube in the (^) slot.""

*If ignored again*

""I am simply an automated response system, I have no problem repeating forever""

Message will just repeat from now on


*If player doesn't do as asked*
(String2)



Main story continues:

*If final cube is placed in, 'blue'*

""There you go. You've got this, im sure you don't need my help anymore. Good luck Employee #002!"" 

""Oh, and heres a little gift.""

*A opening becomes visible on the top of the board and an 4 digit counter, like the ones you see on a calculator or alarm clock pops out*

""The more you get right, the higher the counter goes to. Get one wrong, and you lose a point. You may get rewards for good preformance""

*A random colored cube spawns*

From now on, you just put cubes in and get higher scores, if you put one in you lose a point and the cube gets launched out of the slot.

(Any devs who are willing to attempt this game can add easter eggs at this point, like for example 1337 cubes might give you a computer or something. Just random stuff, you can honestly do whatever you want :)

(If you reach 9999 the counter should reset and the narrator should pop in a 
""Wow, thats alot of cubes! If you weren't a simulation I would have promoted you.""


ACT 2 (The accident)

Upon wandering too the back of console (the machine that you put cubes into) there's a red button with a glass case around it, this case only opens when you finish the tutorial, aka when he stops talking to you.

If the button gets pressed, the narrator will say:

""Oh no, you shouldn't have pressed that. Didn't I tell you not to press buttons? No? Oh, oops.""

*The chute dispenses a purple cube*

""Gah! Don't pick that up, leave it there. I'll fix this,  just give me a moment, DO NOT PUT IT IN THE SLOTS.""

*if player leaves it for like 10 seconds*

""There, I have re-routed the button controls. Press it again to remove the cube.""

If the player presses the button again, the cube will fade away with a pop and the random Random Red Green or Blue cubes will continue to spawn normally unless the button is pushed again.

*If button is pushed again the narrator will yell*

""Why did you press it again? I can't fix it now. Look what you've done now.""

*ACT 2 continues normally now*

If player puts the purple cube in any of the 3 slots, the counter will start to flick to random numbers and the white void you where in has now faded to a black.

""No, oh no. This isn't good at all, I better cut the simu-"" 

Narrator stops mid-sentence

""Nevermind, hey Employee #2 behind the console there should be a plug, would you pull it for me?""

*If player pulls it, all objects will disappear and you'll be left in a black void. But then the void turns back to white, and you are once again presented with the console, chute and the narrators welcome. (Plug doesn't show up untill red button is pressed.)

From then on the story will repeat, but address you as employee #003 instead of two. If you get to that point and reset the game again, it will go up a number, and so on. 

*If player doesn't pull the plug, the game will reset on its own, you'll be back in the white void with a fresh new console, but this time there is no narrator.*

-end, for now-

I know that wasn't much of a quick run down, more like 25% of the entire story. Basically you do different things for different endings, if this is added to steam each ending could be an achievement. If you lads think this is a good game idea I'll post a pastbin link with a more detailed story line including all the ending and somewhat thought of easter eggs, also this is heavily inspired by The Stanley Parable, if you didnt already notice.

Reference/Key for this mess: 

https://imgur.com/a/2PfdkFp - full album

I sent in a ticket because I ran out of options when trying to fix my base station with the blinking red light, got a swift caring response back walking me through some steps and clarifying some facts. Fast forward a few months as this sort of things stresses me, I finally get round to responding with the information required.

A few days later I'm given a tracking number and told to pack the base station and a controller (right side trackpad issue) and they'll ""take care of this"" for me. 
When there's a chance at getting money the customer service is nice and quick. [Picture 1](https://imgur.com/ORRpEqe) 

No later than the next day I've been asked to pay near £120 for the repairs, being told my base station is no longer under warranty when it is and my controller due to a scratch/white paint from my cupboard on the end of the circular sensor needing me to pay for the full body kit to be replaced. [Picture 2](https://imgur.com/99nY8oD) [Picture 3](https://imgur.com/LzGVpT1)

Wanting to take this one item at a time I ask about the base station because that was beyond confusing. I get an email completely making me relieved, right? [Picture 4](https://imgur.com/qaj7CRP)

No - I check the ticket numbers and its a conflicting statement. Ticket number ending in 82 is the controller, ending in 80 is the base station. Meaning they're repairiing the wrong device. [Picture 5](https://imgur.com/JhtBJNG) [Picture 6](https://imgur.com/g2ilDLs)

Now its near Christmas and I'm currently expecting to receive a controller in a week or so when it should be the base station as promised. I'm reaching out to them through email, trading standards &amp; twitter whilst communicating with others who have had a similar issue.

[Picture 7](https://imgur.com/gDyinmF) is just about the controller and how if I was to ask it would be rejected to waive the inspection fee and just return it to me.

Any help is appreciated!


EDIT: 09/12/2019

I'll include my email to them and the response I get from here on out, thanks @RustDragon for the fair point.

I've received [word](https://imgur.com/a/D4MVj0O) from Vive and it seems like good news regarding the base station, I'm assuming by 'fix this issue' it's an optimists dream that it's the controller they're fixing, so I'll need to work on getting it back as they've informed me they don't do partial repairs [here](https://imgur.com/a/9dueLvF)

TL;DR
HTC are refusing to give me my product that I paid for unless I give them more than half the repair fee just to receive it in the same condition as I sent it in.

My play space is literally the minimum size SteamVR will allow, however. I don’t need that much slack on the HMD side in order to move around, so it seems unlikely that I would get tangled.

Vive,Bring a real heavy bag in with Vive Pucks.,"My Family was playing BOXVR tonight (we also play thrill of the fight, with fun on the heavy bag and body dummy) and I was thinking if the **Vive puck** could be used not only to bring boxing gloves in but **what about an actual heavy bag**.

I think this could get away with just two pucks but would be further customized with four pucks (for gloves).

Thing to question first off, can a game be coded for this, it would need to be set up correctly in your space.  Pretty much specifically for the game but hey all Gym equipment, bags etc are anyhow.

• Could a heavy bag be brought in with a **Vive puck** on top and on the bottom back side with the base stations fixed to properly track and pucks secured, we know gloves can be brought in.

• Could the **coding account delivered bag weight as input options** to help with bag motion tracking?

• Could the bag while in game have a **visual overlay arcade point system** to score and maybe even rhythm (think top right and bottom right side \*Behind the bag has an affixed glow or flash indicator for a hook and circle indicators on the face of the bag for straights and jabs when called up).

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly, if this could be done it would be niche I know but **how awesome would it be to have something you could for the first time (as far as i know) actually feel a real life impact from while in VR and not a simulated impact**, really as far as I know it would be the first real world experience and actually could be done, right now!   Or does this seem far fetched?   I personally would set up a space just for this to try out myself if I could even code a game for it =\\

Vive,What has changed on the Original Vive since release?,"Another post was asking if buying a used original Vive headset was still worthwhile and a good introduction to VR. It had some good answers which helped me, but the questions I have now are a little different.

(Honestly you can probably skip the big wall of text here and just skip to the questions at the end. This is just background about why I am asking and is included to help you all provide better recommendations.)

Background: I have spent most of today watching and reading reviews on the various main brands of headsets, (Valve Index, HTC Vive, Vive Pro, Cosmos, and the Oculus Rift, Rift S, and Quest) and haven’t really gotten as close to a decision as I would have liked. At the very start, before watching any reviews, I was considering a Vive Pro because I could find “used” ones (minor cosmetic damage kind of used) for ~~~$500,~~ now seeing more like $700-$800 (I was probably remembering that price entirely wrong) but a lot of the reviews I have seen have made me realize that’s not really what I’m looking for. I don’t really want to go for an Oculus because Facebook owns them and I don’t want to support their rampant privacy invasion. That’s just a personal choice. I more recently have been considering a refurbished/used Vive from the Vive website (so technically “Certified, Pre-Owned”) which are only $400. I have played with a friend’s PlayStation VR and I enjoyed it, so I have no reason to believe I’ll hate VR entirely, but I’d rather not spend $1000 on an Index and then use it only a handful of times. I *could* afford it, but I’m just not comfortable spending that much when I don’t have much experience yet. The common opinion seems to be the Cosmos is garbage so I’m steering clear of that for now. I’m open to lesser known brands as long as the headset is still decent, but I have yet to really come across much on them other than they exist.

I intend to be using the headset with my PC (Windows), primarily for games. One I’m excited for at the moment would be Subnautica because that was a great game and will hopefully be a whole new experience in VR. I’ve got a good space that I think should well behind my desk.

A lot of the reviews on the original Vive that I have found are from 2016 and seem to be from around the time of release. Obviously things have changed since then, which brings us to...


*Question 1:*

What has changed and been fixed since release? What concerns of the reviews from release can I ignore?

*Question 2:*

Are there other headsets that you all recommend I look at?

*Question 3:*

In the aforementioned post, someone recommended the Samsung Odyssey Plus. I’ll be looking for reviews shortly but I wouldn’t mind some more input on it. Does anyone have experience with it and care to share?


And in general, any advice you can offer to help me on my search would be appreciated!

Edit for fixing some information, at to add another question:

*Question 4:*

How important is accurate tracking? What are the effects of inaccurate tracking? This keeps coming up in reviews and I realized I don’t understand yet what difference that actually makes. It’s one thing for your hand to “float away,” but is it really that bad to have it a few millimeters out of place?",1575787124.0,1,9,129422

Vive,So 1.0 hardware is compatible with Base stations 2.0 but 2.0 hardware isn't compatible with base stations 1.0? Is that correct?,"I'm a little confused. (editing for clarity because I butchered the title)

It seems that **v2 headsets and controllers** *are* compatible with **base stations 1.0**.

But **v2 basestations** are ***not*** compatible with **v1 headsets and controllers**?

Meaning, if I upgrade my base stations to v2 buy purchasing the index kit, they will **never** work with OG vive controllers, pucks, HMD etc?

Having forward compatibility but not backward compatibility seems, dumb to me. Maybe I'm reading this wrong.

Edit: ok so I'm not reading this wrong, Basically, if I upgrade to an index and EVER find myself in a situation where I want to go back to the old controllers, or maybe get a vive pro, I have to downgrade the base stations.

I noted that one application on the list has not yet been released, while another had been renamed from its earlier incarnation.  In addition, I've included Glycon Pro which is not sold through the Steam store, but instead is a utility for Motion Capture that supports the trackers.

I've recently added Sansar to my list after a fellow Redditor alerted me to its support (thank you)!  Without further adieu, my current list:

Vive,Vive Intermittent Fault - Loses Stereoscopic View,"My Vive (original) has developed a weird intermittent problem. It randomly stops displaying the image stereoscopically. Or else it suddenly decides to display completely the wrong projection for stereoscopic viewing.

It plays normally for maybe 10 or 20 minutes, then suddenly it'll decide to no longer display a stereoscopic image. Both eyes are rendered and both displays are on and working, but either both eyes are displaying the same image or the image is displayed in completely the wrong stereo projection and it becomes unviewable. If you close one eye it looks fine but not with two eyes.

If you put the headset down and let it go into standby, then pick the headset back up again the image is then fine and rendered correctly.

Does anyone have any ideas?

Thank You",1575728795.0,1,0,129422
Vive,"We released our new update ""Tesseract Abyss"" for Swords of Gargantua","Hi all,

We released new free DLC for Swords of Gargantua, called Tesseract Abyss!

It's a rogue-lite mode that can be done solo or through multiplayer. Players move downwards into the ""abyss"" fighting in different areas that are chosen from a random selection after each stage.

Along the way you'll earn power-ups, can collect weapons, craft them into stronger weapons and level up your own character's base abilities. There'll even be a shop that appears from time to time which you can buy items (like power-ups and health) through the coin you earn by winning battles.

If you die, you'll carry everything over into the next play minus your initial level. It's pretty tricky so you'll most likely die a few times. Looking forward to seeing everyone progress through it!

Please check it out and let me know what you think!

I saw a suggestion someplace saying that the bluetooth something or another might have died inside the controller, but I'm hoping that's not the case, cause one of these controllers is $120 and christmas just blew through my wallet.

I have VR myself at home, a Vive as well, and the games run through Steam VR and a few other internal systems, so I’m really hoping it has something to do with the ‘public’ software.

The games based in Unreal Engine 4, and was never designed to use a Tracker, but we do anyways. It was tacked on right before it shipped, probably because it’s a buggy mess.. One of the PCs has been coming up with ‘Fatal Error’ when trying to start the experience.

And it doesn’t happen consistently either, about 80% of the time it’ll crash, then it’ll work for no apparent reason. What’s going on?

Vive,OG Vive Motion Blur and Warping,"I have the OG Vive and this problem started suddenly about a year ago. I first noticed it in SteamVR home with the text that shows your games and other rooms you can join. If I move my head, the text will warp and trail. It is worse as I turn my head and look through the periphery of each lens. Happens equally on both sides. Once I keep my head still, it mostly goes away. Most all games are still playable, but if I stand still in a game environment and move my head around, I can see the environment warping a little bit as well. Issues I've ruled out are any headset adjustments (IPD, lens distance) and headset positioning on my face. I turned off motion smoothing and toggled a few software settings without success.

System specs are: 

OG Vive w/ original lighthouses

GTX 970 x 2 in SLI (Old I know. Tried to fix the problem by separating SLI and switching from one graphics card to the next, neither of which fixed it, so I put them back into SLI).

i7 4790K 4ghz

16gb DDR3 ram

Any ideas as to why this might be happening and is there anything else I can try? I'm hoping my lenses haven't become damaged over time, but the problem is equal in both eyes, so I suspect a software, graphics card, or headset problem. Things are still playable, but seeing the trailing and warping is very bothersome.",1575660623.0,1,2,129422
Vive,"So, what actually is the upgraded/second gen. of Vive? The Cosmos? The Pro?","So I've just been getting really interested in getting a VR headset. It's always interested me, but now I'm am feeling really close to pulling the trigger. But, when looking through the deals on Black Friday and Cyber Monday, I almost came out of it more confused. It really seems like the Rift S could be okay because I like the controllers, but the lower refresh rate, and the fact that Oculus is Zucc tech, pushed me away from it pretty quickly. The Index is still a little too high for my liking (not saying it's not worth it, just that I don't feel like splurging). WMD's are better than you expect but still have tracking issues. So, I usually end the thought process that Vive is the way to go.

But I don't really know what to get. Spec-wise, the OG Vive seems a little old for me regarding resolution specifically, but as a whole I still don't feel like it's enough. I don't know where the road goes after that, though. The Vive Pro looks pretty good spec-wise, but without having any controllers or lighthouses right now, I'd be better off getting an Index. The Cosmos looked like it might've been what I was actually wanting, but I've only heard bad things of it. In the end, I almost am where I start in the beginning because nothing feels right for me to buy. Is there anything down the pipeline that might be popping up, like more upgrades or updates?

Vive,HMD weighs more on one side? (Original Vive),"I just got a (Used) Vive today after using an Oculus for the last 1.5 years, and have been playing around for a little bit, and I have noticed the right side weighs down on my head considerably more than the left, and sits crooked on my face most of the time. I'm always grabbing the headset and readjusting it because my right eye is always off center except for the few seconds I readjust before it falls away again.

&amp;#x200B;

I've tried pulling the cables out just a bit from the headset to loosen the slack, and that did not help, and i have the vive delux strap on. I've tried looser and tighter, adjusting my ipd even to see, but nothing alleviates it.

&amp;#x200B;

It's really quite frustrating, Did I do something wrong with the strap or something?

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: Re put on the strap and am wearing the hmd much tighter and it seems to fit on nicely. It's not on painfully tight or anything, just much more than I'm used to with the oculus. So far so good now!

I am wondering.. if you top these up and then put them in a drawer for a few months, will they be drained dry?

The problem: if i plug it in/power the linkbox i get 2 sound notifications, Multimedia and VIVE Cosmos. the multimedia audio disappears after about 5 seconds, but the Vive Cosmos is still to be found under Windows settngs-&gt; Devices.

I try to connect to Viveport, and i try to connect to SteamVR, but have had no success. SteamVR has never displayed anything but ""please plug in your VR headset"" 

&amp;#x200B;

Trying different USB ports, power cycling, refreshing USB connections in steamvr, enable direct display mode, and finally Reinstalling my OS has done nothing, reinstalling steamVR, steam and viveport quite a few times, no change..

The best game I've played so far was Arizona Sunshine, and that game would barely even be noticed in the traditional gaming space. I've refunded half a dozen games already because they were just pure garbage.

Oh and then there's a few multiplayer shooter games. Competitive games are a young man's crowd.

I am so excited about this VR headset and yet I don't feel like there's much left to do with it. 

Beat Saber is fun, but I've never been big on rhythm games.

Blade &amp; Sorcery is insanely fun for a few hours, but even with all the mod support it's still basically the same thing over and over. Also I am not looking forward to explaining myself to my wife if she ever sees what I'm doing in that game.

Gorn is the same thing but now everything is made out of dildos or something. Pass.

Vive,audio distortion/weirdness on Vive Pro - USB C to 3.5mm workaround?,"hey folks, i know this has been talked about a lot, but not recently - furthermore all the threads i searched are archived so i can't bump a topic, so i'm forced to retread old ground, of sorts.

anyway i'm a teacher at a university and we purchased a Vive Pro headset which worked fine with a older desktop. then we switched to a laptop - Alienware 17"" - and now from the Vive Pro's HMD audio  i'm getting very strange digital artifacts - buzzing, chirps, etc, especially when playing audio that stops and starts. the laptop's speaker and headphone audio are totally fine. so, i did a lot of diving into reddit threads to find that there are a lot of variations on this issue, and it seems to be related to the 'Vive Pro Mutimedia device driver' (yes it's accurately misspelled) which seems to be a USB Audio device going out to the Link box. i did testing outside of VR just in a browser opening up Youtube and setting the laptop to use the Vive as the audio output, and the audio had the same glitchy behavior, so it's not just in VR that the issue happens, at least for me.

fixes i've tried:according to one account, the NVIDIA HD Audio drivers were possibly interfering. so i removed them, and just used the 'Mutimedia driver'. no change in behavior. then i reinstalled the HD Audio drivers and disabled the non-HD driver. same effect - no change. i've unplugged the link box and restarted it, and it doesn't seem to do anything either. however running a long audio cable from the headphone jack on the laptop to a set of earbuds resulted in clear, glitch-free audio, though now with two cables to deal with instead of one. one thought i did have concerning the new SteamVR audio oriented update (1.8) that just dropped, is i wonder if it actually was a step backward and is causing these issues. would love to rollback to an earlier driver to test but search results covering how to downgrade SteamVR are depressingly sparse to non-existent.

so continuing from the workaround perspective, i'm aware that you can purchase a USB C to audio adapter hooked up to the port on the HMD, but curious what's a good one? would i need one with a right angle USB connector so as to be unobtrusive? if someone could help me with some product links i'd be grateful! likewise anyone with similar issues just to get confirmation or fixes would also be appreciated. thanks in advance!",1575525219.0,1,4,129422

Vive,Crazy behavior of one of two base stations 2.0,"Hey guys, I got the Vive Pro Full Kit yesterday and everything works fine so far. However on the Power Management Tab I discovered, that one base stations has a connection failure, it works absolutely fine while playing tho. I make it short:

\- Everything is freshly updated and on the newest version

\- Power Management: One BS is working fine the other has a warning sign: ""Connection failure, click refresh to try again"", when I turn off VR, the working BS is going into sleep mode (intended) while the other obviously not.

\- Channel Configuration: The BS is discovered and working, but I cant switch channels. When I click on it it says: ""BS requires a device update to enable channel configuration.

\- In the Device Manager (Windows 10) everything looks good.

\- The other base station is working absolutetly fine altho I updated both successfully.

\- Both work fine while gaming

Vive,The Cosmos is the right idea sold the wrong way,"I've had a chance to try out the Cosmos and quickly noticed it could have filled a niche in the market, but doesn't. It's strength is versatility, as it can do pretty much anything - inside out, base stations, wireless, etc. 

I think one reason it is failing is the lack of versatility in purchasing options. They should sell the headset cheaply with no faceplate or features, and let people purchase their favorite accessories seperately. Not many people will be happy purchasing it as is, bundled with junk at a premium price. For example, right now if you wanted to use base stations, you're still stuck paying for the cost of an unused inside out faceplate which is a large extra expense. 

The wands are absolute garbage and I think many people would be happy if they could combine index knuckles while using the Cosmos headset. Again you're forced to purchase spendy HTC accessories that are best left unused. With inside out, the tracking is at best marginal. However a huge mistake was needing a total of four AA batteries to run these things for just a few hours.  USB recharging is the only solution that makes sense, and adding more disposable batteries to an already crappy design is just a big step backwards. It's possible the inside out tracking can be further improved through firmware updates, and current users should consider themselves volunteer beta testers while they try.

All that aside, the Cosmos has some great video and audio qualities and is one of the more versatile headsets as far as possible options that can be added. The flip up option is pretty neat. Because it already comes bundled with all of the low end gear, anyone wanting to add stations or wireless is going to be out a ton of money, which makes a high end set a better option instead.",1575357826.0,126,54,129422

Vive,Is using a DVI/D to VGA to the monitor downgrade the VR experience ?,"Hello guys !

Just for some context (if you like to read my bad english, if not, TL;DR at the bottom), a friend of mine recently bought the HTC Vive, and because she didn't know how to set it up, i helped her throught pains and frustrations on mic.

The thing is, i sold her my old GTX 970 MSI (for cheap don't worry) to replace her old graphics card that wouln't have run anything anymore.

But when she had to plug things, i've felt dumb to not thinking about it; the HDMI cable was already taken.

For more context, the 970 has : 1 HDMI / 1 Display Port / 1 DVI-I / 1 DVI-D

Welp i quickly told her to buy an adaptator because her monitor has only a HDMI or VGA input.

So she went out to buy a VGA/DVI adaptator and everything went fine, until she started to play it and said it was ""quite pixely"". Note; i can't try this by myself as we are living 5 hours away, and my perception would have been corrupted by the Index.

By reading a tutorial [here on steampowered.com](https://support.steampowered.com/steamvr/HTC_Vive/) i've seen; *""If you don't have any HDMI output available, you can use a DisplayPort to Mini DisplayPort.""*

**So my question is:** Is using a DVI/VGA adaptator to the monitor change/downgrade the quality of the Vive ? I hope my english is understandable.

**TL;DR:** Friend new to VR, not enough ports at the back of the graphics card, switch the HDMI to the monitor to the VIVE and using a DVI/VGA adaptator to the monitor.
Friend complained about the pixely thing. Question is; does the adaptator change/downgrade the quality of the Vive ?

Vive,HTC Vive Pro- (Review and comparison with modded lenses),"\----TL:DR- Can skip to my 2 ¢ below----

I have had the original Vive for about 3 years or so and I wanted a higher resolution headset. I have not had a reason to upgrade HMD's and was holding off. With the recent announcement of Half Life: Alyx, Metal of Honor VR, and then Boneworks coming out in a few days I had the itch to burn some more money on this niche market. Well, Vive Pro was $200 off last week and was almost the same amount as the Index, headset only. The 120-144hz refresh rate of the Index and it still being $100 cheaper than the Vive Pro's (sale price) seemed like the way to go. But I wanted to retain my Vive Wireless attachment and Index does not have a solution for this yeeeet! So I got the Pro, watch the Index get some new tech right after this review and releases wireless capabilities...

I have modded the lenses, upgraded my pc more than enough (pretty much built a new one will show some specs below), added a Vive wireless attachment, wireless ModMic, deluxe audio strap, made some custom foam inserts/pads for added comfort or support, Index controllers, special straps for my Vive wands I made, and a few other odds and ends in order to make VR more enjoyable. I find many little things that annoy me and I have to tweak them. I don't play all the time but I still have logged around 600 hours or more in VR with more than 94 game titles. I play anything from Onward (161 hours played) to Beat Saber and Skyrim VR (with plenty of mods in both) so I would say I am a pretty big enthusiast and I love VR, I don't play many 2d games anymore after I got into it.

OG Vive has to have most of these mods in order for me to play them. Overall the one mod I have to have is the lenses, I can't STAND the Vive and Vive Pro's garbage fresnel lenses at all. I have a few friends who have the same opinion but get a lot of mixed reviews online about the lens swap. After a few friends purchased a Vive, after playing mine a few times, they then asked why mine looks so much better than theirs... the solution to this blurry god ringed ""high quality"" HMD is--- $30 Samsung Gear VR Lens Swap! + adapters. They went proceeded to get new lenses ASAP after I told them.

# ---- 2 ¢: REVIEW/COMPARISON w/ mod----

So I couldn't find anything besides reviews or comparisons on the stock headsets with the OG Vive and Vive Pro so I decided I would make an ass of myself reviewing these with mods. Well many people love the Samsung Gear VR mod yet many do not. I am not sure where people get the idea that the Samsung lenses cause some issue's and they revert back to the fresnel lenses saying they distort the view or they make everything look flat. I have heard this a few times, but have also seen Reddit posts that the reviewer said they absolutely hated the lens mod, just to see an update later saying they installed the lenses backward lulz.

I can say for sure, comparing the the Vive and Vive Pro was not seeming to be worth the money right out of the box the other day. God rays annoy me, the sweet spot is tiny on the OG and Vive Pro lens. The comfort of the Vive Pro is amazing and I can see me enjoying being in VR much longer... yet something seemed wrong about this upgraded HMD. I just dropped $600 on a headset and the resolution did not seem really any better. I couldn't read writing in the Steam Menu, distant Tree's in Skyrim VR were just as blurry as the OG Vive, and I really couldn't justify the headsets price. I was very disappointed besides the better weight distribution making the headset have a much greater wearability vs the Old Vive with a deluxe audio strap.

Swapping out the lenses I couldn't help but feel like I was going to be returning this new HMD as it wasn't worth the money first go, and instead maybe I could give my mother the money to get a new set of teeth. Thank god I was wrong she can continue to starve! NIGHT AND DAY difference in clarity, the sweet spot is improved, and god rings vanish into my terrible memory where I file repressed fragments of my past. But I have already seen this before with the OG Vive w/mod. The thing I really wanted was crisper distant objects, as this was the last thing I needed for a greater immersion. I could make out far off distant objects right away. In Skyrim, Onward, Fallout, and even modded games that are not meant for VR originally... you name it I can see it. Instead of a blob of a tree 100-200 or so yards out, I could see a tree with crisp lines and it not forming into the background like a terrible painting with the colors bleeding together.  *With the stock lenses on the Pro OR on the OG Vive w/ the mod*, this was always the case, distant backgrounds form together, as if you needed glasses and were nearsighted. Up close everything looked great, far away not soo much. But the Vive Pro lets me see a farther distance hands down with the new optics. I would seriously play a OG Vive with the lens mod over the Pro with stock lenses.

I obviously have a bias towards this mod over the stock garbage that who ever came up with should be euthanized, but I also understand these lenses really help people with motion sickness.

&amp;#x200B;

**Image-** Some say you lose 3d image with this mod, maybe it is a little more flat: *8.5/10 from the stock lens 7/10  w/mod*

**Sweet Spot-** Same as the OG Vive w/mod, but you get better FOV. The 15-20% sweet spot upgrades to like 70% w/ mod: *10/10, for both OG and Pro.*

**Clarity-** Distant objects, up close, writing/text all much easier to see now Hands down a *10/10* w/mod  from a *5/10 before*! Likewise with the OG Vive w/mod, but the Pro really has a lot more details at a distance than the OG Vive w/mod. This was what I wanted as I felt immersion in a game like Skyrim is thrown off by a bleeding together background.

**Field of View-** On the OG Vive w/mod you did lose a bit of FOV (5-8%) , but not with the Vive Pro thanks to the telescoping screen! With glasses, you will lose FOV and how much depends on how far they stick out, but I press these babies right up to by corneas so my I can have my ""retinas seared like tuna steaks"": 8\*/10\* as you get a little more binocular feel but not much as you may notice on the OG vive and that the Vives just don't have the best FOV anyway.

**Screen Door-** I did notice a tiny amount but even with the stock HMD, it is much less with the new rez of the Pro! Maybe a little more noticeable with the new lenses popped in but nothing you will see without really trying to notice it. Much better than the OG Vive! Especially in low light/high contrast locations: *8/10*

**God Rays-** The awful god rays are gone, but still get a little bit of haze/fog off of low light/high contrast area's (like if you are in a dungeon or crypt in Skyrim and the candles cause a awful god ray, you get a little haze, still 100x's better than being blinded by the fresnel lenses).

**Performance-** This does not really pertain to the mod, but overall some games don't like the wireless with the higher resolution. Most dev's have done a great job and they work fine. In less optimized games you might have to kick the setting back a little as I did with games like Cosmic Sugar. Which is almost unplayable for the Vive pro? =(

**Barrel Distortion-** There is some small distortion on the edges of the new lens like the old Vives mod, but it is easily changed with swapping some lines of code out. I did not test it without the new lines of code and I am using the 2nd set of upgraded ""code"". I think they have the 3rd set out now. Either way you have to look at the edge of your lens to see this and is not noticeable unless you are picky as all hell, in that case grow up children (as I sit here and complain about all the little things I hated on my OG Vive)..... hypocrisy at its finest!

Thanks for reading! Hope my incoherent rambling, poor grammar and nonsense was somewhat helpful.

*ME*\--*""I felt like I was wasting money after getting the Wireless attachment and not seeing much for new content coming out in the land of VR, after Half Life was announced I realized that the market was soon to explode and VR would consume my life.... well hopefully after wasting another $600+ on this crap""*

Vive,GearVR lens mod - distortion tips?,"Good day,

I was able to get my hands on a 2016 GearVR for $20 and a buddy printed me the lens adapters, so I went ahead and did the lens mod.

Amazingly clear. Fantastic.

Naturally there is some distortion and I applied a bunch of the various fixes. Some worked better than others, and now I am trying to dial it in with  SteamVR-Undistort, starting with the V3 profile. 

Having some success, but I'm wondering if anyone has tips on using it more efficiently? 

As well, I've read that I should do it with the green crosshairs, but is this the crosshair with all the hash marks, or the simple crosshair that's just two intersecting lines?

Cheers.

Update:  got it all dialed in, almost completely perfect! Used V4 of the distortion fix and did a bit of additional tweaking in the Undistort tool, pretty much just around the edges. For $20 this had a major impact on my experience, I love it.

I also see why some people can't stand it, before I got it dialed in (took hours and tried every version of the fix I could find) this made me fairly dizzy and looked really distorted. It seems you need the patience and time to really fiddle with it for this to work well for some people, although my wife threw it on (before it was dialed in) and couldn't see any distortion at all.",1575321744.0,6,24,129422

Vive,VIVE official certified pre-owned nightmare.,"I've been really wanting to get VR for years now, and just this black friday weekend the vive store was selling them for $350 certified pre-owned, free shipping and everything. Great! So I ordered it, it shows up today, and I can't wait to get things set up. Once everything is set up, all I gotta do is plug in the Linkbox and the headset. So, I go to plug in USB, HDMI, and then.. the power cable was the wrong size. I go and check and my heart sinks. I got three identical power cables and they only fit the base stations. I guess the third one was supposed to be the power adapter that would've fit the Linkbox to power the headset, however, that cable is too large to plug into the Linkbox. It only fits the base stations.

Has anyone else received the wrong power adapter? HTC wasn't much help with support. They offered to have me pay to ship it back, wait a few weeks, and eventually get an answer. Or, wait a few more weeks to get the right power adapter sent to me as they were apparently short on supply.",1575330632.0,3,11,129422

I told him (by text) buy a couple Rift S's today on Cyber Monday for $700 total and go to Best buy and tell them you want a minimum of i7 7700k, GTX 1060, 8gb RAM

Also: he wants to play online games with me since he never gets to see me so I thought we could play VRChat and Pavlov

Can this* PC run both smoothly? (I sent him the link)

I spent a good 6ish hours getting project cars working decently enough, and it's pretty awesome. The rendered interiors are amazing, and the hud is pretty cool too.

Either I'm way ahead of everyone, or I get behind and it feels like there is no possible way to catch up.

Yesterday my headset crashed (black screen in headset, no longer being picked up by base stations) and SteamVR said I needed a firmware update for my headset.

Firmware update fails. Says I need to plug in my headset to the computer or try unplugging headset and plugging it back in.

Best I can tell from Steam VR Troubleshooting, and Vive and Viveport troubleshooting, you shouldn't need to plug in a wireless adapter headset to update the firmware.

I've rebooted the USB and reinstalled them, with no luck. 

My SteamVR is currently in a loop of knowing it needs to update drivers and the updates failing. 

I don't have the Pro, but I do have the wireless adapter, so I think I'm in this odd middle ground in terms of places to go for troubleshooting.

Vive,Minimizing VR UI Friction in Fast-Paced Combat,"After dealing with the UI system in Skyrim VR which pulled you out of combat every time you wanted to change attacks, I wanted to create a UI system which effectively allows for real-time combat in non-shooter games.

[My solution](https://i.imgur.com/83GKOGT.mp4) is to have four anchor-points around the screen which, when grabbed, each activate a unique spell. Similarly, different variations of any skill can be toggled by grabbing and quickly releasing any anchor point which effectively allows for real-time access to up-to eight spells. With the Index's large FOV, enough room is left that the viewing experience still feels uncluttered.

There is also an added benefit that four stationary points around the edges of your screen gives you a constant point of focus which can somewhat reduce motion sickness in some people.

Vive,How do I make Vivecraft Seated Mode feel more realistic?,"Hello, I am thinking about playing Vivecraft and I don't have alot of money, so I saw a guide that allows you to play Vivecraft with google cardboard. There is one issue, though, you can only play Vivecraft with google cardboard in Seated mode and not standing up mode. 

That kind of sucked because I don't like how the HUD is straight up over your arm and the mouse is just weird and you can't really use your headset to determine where you are looking and Standing Up mode just feels and looks better, but because of my super low budget, I might not be able to achieve that.

I did some research and found some driver application that allows people to use Wii Remotes as controllers, so maybe I could use standing up mode like that with Wii Motion Plus controllers but the application software costs quite alot, most people do not recommend using Wii Remotes as controllers and the free trial of it kind of sucks.

So I was wondering, is it possible to maybe change how Vivecraft works in Seated Mode so that whenever I move my head, the crosshair moves with the tracking of my head so that I don't have to move my mouse around to aim at where I want to break blocks? I mean, it seems kind of useless to be able to move your head around full 360 degrees, but not be able to aim where your cursor crosshair is.

I was also wondering if I could use Seated Mode whilst standing up so that I could feel more immersed by moving my head and body around whilst using some sort of joytokey software to bind controls to a controller for fun.

(I had an htc vive for 3 years and have had the index since it came out to major market). And i really think I'm missing a game that I would think is super fun. I really like plane games, because planes are just cool. And generally they are combat ones like war thunder. But I want one that has an airplane, maybe 2 seater with a pilot and a gunner in the back like early ww2 american planes. Or maybe a full bomber with like 7 people in it, but ita not just where you are controlling everything like war thunder. It should be like star trek bridge crew, where one person controls everything. And maybe if theres not enough people switching positions.you have to fight off enemy aircraft, get bombs ready to drop, drop them and fly back safely. ( game would probably last like 20 or 30 mins like the submarine game, which is good but not exacly what I am looking for). And I dont want to stop at just aircraft. So for tanks they can have a driver, gunner/loader(being a loader would be boring unless its shared with the commander, maybe there is a loader which is a commander ane has a machine gun to use for AA or for ground troops.) And a machine gunner up front too like a sherman or something. A tank game like this would be absoloutly amazing.

Vive,I’m in the market for a VR headset since Black Friday is going on. Is buying a VIVE used worth it?,"I was pretty set on buying a VIVE until I realized they aren’t restocking them. I see a lot of people on here selling their old VIVEs. I’d prefer to have original packaging in order to help my dumbass set the damn thing up, but other than that I’m fine with buying used.

Would it be more worth it to get a new Rift S instead? I’ve always thought of the Rift S as inferior to the VIVE, but I’m not quite sure how inferior it is. I’m also not interested in the Quest since it plays like shit in VRchat. I’d like my money to be worth it. Any help would be appreciated, thanks!",1575065807.0,3,14,129422
Vive,HTC VIVE Bluetooth questions...,"Hey, so I've had my Vive for a year now, and since I got myself a newer phone (Xiaomi MI5) {I had a rusty iPhone 5s xD} and decided that I could pair it with the headset so that I could know if someone's calling, texting me etc, but the damned thing keeps disconnecting after:

1: Turning on Steam Home

2: Turning on any game or app

3: Switching games/apps

Vive,PSA: The $5 Steam Controller can be harvested for parts to repair your Vive wands!,"I think this is fairly common knowledge, but as per subject the track pads in the Steam Controller are a 100% swap-out replacement for the track pads in the Vive wands.  As many of us have found out the hard way, those track pads will break the plastic housing and pop out (ripping the ribbon cable) with a solid crack against the wall at the wrong angle.

The only difference I've noticed in performing this operation several (4?) times now is that a) the Steam controller has only one fully smooth pad and b) the ribbon cable on the Steam controller is slightly longer than the native Vive wand cable, but still fits perfectly as a replacement.  Otherwise, the connector head, form factor, mount points and responsiveness are identical.  No glue, no nonsense.  Just swap the part and you're back in the game!

If your kids have VR Gorn parties, you will want a few of these ;)

I would always recommend pursuing warranty repairs if that is an option, but for most Vive owners, that is no longer the case.  You will of course need to watch a vid or two on carefully opening up your controllers and wands, but the operation is pretty straightforward, and doable with minimal experience if you have the right screwdriver.

With 4 boys and 2 VR rooms at my house, this has saved us a ton of money on repairs.  Highly recommended.  At $5 on sale right now, I suggest any Vive owner stock up and keep them in a closet as cheap spare parts!

Remember that each controller also comes with that magical Steam USB stick, so if you're upgrading to Index, you can use those dongles to pair your old wands as strap-on foot trackers...",1574902586.0,430,43,129422

Vive,How big of a difference will overclocking further make?,"Hey guys, I'm posting this here specifically rather than an overclocking forum because in VR we have other considerations, and a few FPS may well make a difference. I have an 8700K processor that is running at 4.8Ghz, but runs pretty hot at the moment at load, like high 80s, or low 90s, sometimes worse. I'm using the wireless adapter, and using FPS VR you can see that it does cap out my processor, not infrequently. 

So, the question for anyone who has tried is would it be worth delidding the processor, and maybe upgrading the cooler also? De-lidding would cost around $50 all told, and it looks like an upgraded cooler is more like $100. I definitely *could* spend that money, but it's not insignificant by any means. I'm guessing that doing both of these things would allow me to get up to around 5.2Ghz at slightly cooler temps than I'm at right now, as the cooler alone appears to give a 10-15c difference at load, and delidding is more like 15-20c, so that would be pretty significant together. 

How big of a difference would a 400Mhz be in terms of VR performance with the wireless adapter? If it's 1FPS, that's definitely not worth it to me. If it's 5-10FPS, it may well be.",1574981009.0,1,4,129422

Vive,My computer keeps crashing while playing VR,"So I got an RX 580 4GB refurbished graphics card from newegg back in July, and got a used Vive off craigslist in September. They've both been working perfectly for months with little to no problems arising. However, a few days ago when I was trying to play beat saber, SteamVR kept crashing and so would Steam itself. After 3 or 4 tries, I restarted my computer and tried again. It still was acting a bit weird and took a long time to load, but eventually I got it to start up. Then last night I bought some new games, the seemingly problem one being sprint vector. I had my friends try it out and when they were selecting the character it kept getting errors saying ""out of memory"", which is weird because I have 16GB of ram in my computer. After it crashed twice we went back to beat saber. After about 20 minutes of playing, it randomly crashed my whole computer. We turned it back on and now every time I try to play it, it lasts about 3 minutes before crashing. My question is, what is the problem? My first guess would be the graphics card since it was refurbished, but the low memory error I keep getting makes me think it might be the ram. Below I have the specs to my computer. (I'm kinda hoping it's the graphics card so I can upgrade to an RTX)

A lot of times when I want to quickly access my desktop from within VR I'm greeted by a full-screen game window with no way to close or minimize. 

Is there any way to generally prevent that? Or do you have to change it for every game individually (if even possible...)?",1574950689.0,1,0,129422
Vive,Index controllers + Pavlov VR = wow,"I just received my Index controllers.  Figured I was going to get them with Alyx, so I might as well get them now.  

So far I've only used them with the lab program as well as Pavlov VR since Pavlov is the main game that I play these days (close to 700 hours logged in it).  

It took about 30 minutes to get comfortable with the new mechanics, but once I did, holy crap.  Pavlov is really a very different game with the new controllers, and I'm guessing the same is probably true for other games as well.  

It's much better.  Way more immersive.  The main mechanic I had to learn was holding the gun.  The default position is an open hand as in normal life.  But if you do that in the game, you drop the gun (unlike with the wands where you hold onto the gun until you release them with a button click).  In order to hold onto the gun, you have to close your grip around the controller as you would close your grip around the grip of the gun.  Makes sense.  But the really cool thing is when you grip with the other hand as well.  You just grip your other controller as you would in real life.  No buttons.  It took some getting used to, but after I did, I found it much better, faster, and more intuitive.  

And then there's picking things up.  Medicine bottles, grenades.  Holstering, putting primary guns on your back.  Pavlov is a super great game, don't get me wrong, but there is quite a bit of room for improvement for interactivity.  Things are a little glitchy, but the new mechanics really got me thinking 'Man, this is incredibly realistic, more immersive, and in a way that really improves gameplay.'.  

I found that even within 30 minutes of getting used to the new controls, that I kinda had an advantage over the players who didn't have the Index controllers.  I noticed that the controllers were less in the way, and that I was more 'in the game'.  I could fire the pistols more easily and accurately, even the Barret.  But as I said, it improves the game play and the ability of the player to perform  in the game in the right way.  

Then there's flipping people off.  I'll be like 'hey, come here'  to a teammate.  I come over to him real close and then slowly and gingerly reveal my middle finger.  Its' really awesome.

Vive,Question regarding the Lighthouse Placement (Gen1),"Hey guys,

I just have a quick question regarding the placement of the lighthouses of the HTC VIVE, so the old ones, not the new ones.

I have this room ([https://imgur.com/a/SJuWX8T](https://imgur.com/a/SJuWX8T)) and want to place them bove on the wall where the dart board is placed. One in each corner. The wall is 4,10 meters wide, so they are probably about 1,90 to 2 meters apart when I put them up. Also the wall has a height of 2,60 meters and I am planning to put them up at around 2,40 meters. The direction I would mainly look while playing would be away from the wall, so facing towards the location of the picture taken.

Would this placement be possible with using the sync cable connected to both lighthouses?

Vive,Are there any good articles about the performance improvements from the HTC Vive Pro Eye?,"Its been a while since I've read anything about Foveated Rendering.   Im using a Rift so I dont always keep up with the news from the Vive side of things.  But the Vive Pro Eye was release earlier this year right?  Are there any good articles  with real world testing, about how much the foveated rendering actually reduces GPU workload?  I have seen things where Oculus stated in some of their testing, the foveated rendering allowed for a 20x savings in what needed to be rendered.  Im just curious what this looks like in the real world currently.      I want to know what peoples opinions are, that have used it.  Ive got a 980ti and a 6700k right now.  Id love to hear that with foveated rendering, that those specs would become more than enough for future High end headsets since it only renders such a small area at full resolution.

&amp;#x200B;

I know foveated rendering is still very new and still being worked on, and everything is subject to change.  Im just wanting some good stuff to read, thats not just from keynotes or development articles,  to keep me hyped for when it does go mainstream.   I just want to see how the current version has been working for people with real world examples.   Ive tried finding some stuff to read or watch, but all i can find just seems to be stuff from early this year, before the headset was launched.

When I kill some of these, they instantly come back sometimes opening something related to SteamVR, such as ""Pair a controller.""

I will say I am happy with my purchase, it takes a brain rework to ""let go"" of them after years of holding the wands constantly. It has to be said, the tracking is amazing.

Vive,Is the HTC Vive still worth it now? (Looking forwards to Half Life: Alyx),"Hey,

I was considering buying the standard HTC Vive (£500) for Half Life: Alyx. I obviously will play other VR games too.

My Dad hates the idea of buying a VR headset that has already been out for 3-4 years and is utilsing ""older tech."" Although I see his point, I don't agree with him saying I should instead buy the ""newer tech"" such as the Steam Index for basically double the price (£900).

Can you outline the advantages and disadvantages around this? I understand the Steam Index has better resolution, refresh rate, fov over the Vive - however that's obviously to be expected for a newer product. I can afford the Steam Index but it is still very expensive.

So, is the HTC Vive (The standard version for about £500) worth it as of 2019/2020?

Vive,New VR (oddly shaped) space...a bit stumped on solution,"I have an OG Vive and used it in my old home office/computer room which was a normal rectangle shape, so easy-peasy setup. A few months ago I moved and my new home office is a loft which is actually waaaay more spacious, except that the ceiling is a sharp slant downwards. One side of the room is a good 20ft tall, the other end is 4ft.

The vive trackers say a minimum height of 6.5ft above the ground is required, so I can't place a tracker at the 4ft side of the room...so my only option is to awkwardly place one in the middle of the ceiling slant and cut my play area in half.

I was really looking forward to the **Cosmos** because it seemed like a great upgrade to the Vive and with inside out tracking it would solve this issue. Unfortunately I've just not been impressed with the reviews or hardware, and unfortunately this room is pretty dark most of the day, which I hear doesn't work well for the Cosmos.

I've also heard the **Valve Index** base stations can track without a minimum height (even though they recommend 6ft - it can be used at any height, so my 4ft wall will be fine). That said, the $999 price tag on the index is just a bit steep...

I've been pretty amazed by what **Oculus** has done with the quest and quest link. Having a truly on-the-go VR headset and a PC one is something I thought was years away. That said, I'm worried about it being a visual downgrade even from the OG vive. If I am going to be spending $$ to buy something new, I'd like it to be an improved experience in some way. I'd love to hear if I'm wrong about though!

So, this is where I'm a bit stuck. I'm not sure what the best path forward is for VR right now in my space without spending a ton of money or downgrading the experience slightly. Unless the Vive trackers *will* work with one at &lt;6.5ft after all (if anyone has experience with such, please let me know!).

I 100% lurked on this community for the past two years but I will not forget everything I’ve learned. All the niche games I found out about, quality of life settings, tutorials, etc.. Thanks guys! Here’s to the future of VR!

Edit: For those of you who wanted me to give my 2 cents on the upgrade. I think that it is well worth it. One of my few complaints is that if you have a big head then the shroud that sits on your face may be a bit snug on your temples and give you a pressure headache but with precise tweaking of the knob on the back plus the strap on top you can get it feeling pretty damn comfortable.  For image quality I think that this is well worth the upgrade. You become so much more immersed in the games you are playing when you aren’t constantly distracted by the screen door effect. One last thing, setup was beautifully easy especially since I already had mounts for the base stations. The software also doesn’t make you plug in the base stations to update them which is really nice. If any of you have any tips on where I could started figuring out how to correctly tweak my settings to get the best image quality to performance ratio I would greatly appreciate it. When I first started playing around with the headset my global resolution was set to 136% (what it was set to for the Vice).

Vive,Anywhere I can try an Index in the UK?,"I've posted a couple of times on my city's subreddit, despite being a huge city (Bristol), nobody has ever responded.

I don't mind travelling a little ways to try it, plus I'll be travelling up north before and during Christmas (and back, afterwards) so I'm reasonably flexible about location.

But I've had an OG vive since release date, and while I love it, I don't use it much because it's not the most comfortable to wear and it's such a faff - I know I should get the deluxe audio strap as half my faff is with sorting headphones out, and that thing is still ridiculously expensive. With the Alyx announcement I am considering an upgrade to the Index but I just want to try it first to make sure.

I recall with the Vive they demo'd it in various places, shopping malls, and various video game shops, but the Index? I can't find a whiff of it!

So I have a weird issue now after a year of using my Vive (The exact same Issue was btw the reason i gave back my Oculus to get a vive) Also i had this Issue after 2 Months but it randomly dissappeared. So whenever i Want to play a VR Game i set up the Sensor boxes and plug in the Cable box thing and then plug in the Vive. But since 2 Weeks the LED only lights up in red. Now heres the deal: I checked the hdmi cable, used a different one, checked the Cables  and ports on the vive, checked the hdmi and usb ports on my computer and reinstalled Steam VR. Nothing helped. When I plug the vive in the light is giving me hope that i could use it, but nope. The Second i start steam VR it just changes to red telling me that i am a complete failure and dissappointment in life. Steam Vr then tells me that i am currently playing steam VR changes after 5 seconds to ""searching for your headset"" and then just goes ""steam VR couldnt detect any headset"" While this happens i hear the classic Windows ""device disconnected"" and ""device connected"" sounds multiple times... The onyl thing i could imagine is to check the USB cable. I am gonna order one now to check on later this day. But still i .. jsut feel like thats not the reason.

Does anybody know what else could be the reason and what else i could try?",1574733136.0,1,5,129422

It works pretty much exactly as you think it would; swinging your arms back and forth would make you move forwards in the direction you swing your arms. You can even go backwards if you do the movement behind your back.

It may look silly, but personally it's been the best control scheme I've used. It gives a bit of exercise, it's easier to control where you're going and how fast you're going (your max speed is dependent on your personal speed), and it's been super-fun to use in general. Seeing all these games stick with either dashing or just a single joystick for movement feels disappointing, as there are other, more innovative and fun ways of moving about.",1574676997.0,17,33,129422

I usually wear glasses, but my glasses fit inside the Vive pretty well. Regardless, I decided to wear my contacts to play to really get that VR feel. But that's not the main problem. When I put on my headset, the only place where the views aren't blurry is when I have to push my VR up. Otherwise, the headset tends to sink down and rest right under my cheekbones. I have pretty high cheekbones, so that might be one reason, but another issue is that when the headset slides down, it also almost pulls my cheeks down and my eyelid is stretched down too. I'm not sure how I can fix this or if this should be normal. My eyes feel dry and irritated in just \~10 minutes of gameplay.

Vive,Advice on lighthouse placement with 3 base stations (part deux),"*My original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/Vive/comments/dmsxlx/advice_on_the_placement_of_20_base_stations_in_a. Making a fresh post since I ended up buying a third lighthouse and most advice was on two base stations.*

I've been playing VR for a month with temporary placements at E, on the island between G and D (where the second chair is) and at C behind the couch. So far it's going good. Sometimes I'm losing track on my left controller (facing the TV) but that might be due to the how placement of my temporary locations of the lighthouses.


B and C are not that convenient to wire power to them due to the many windows on that wall. There is a power socket at the bottom between B and C but there is no drywall to the top unless I buy a really long extension cable for the 12V. There is a small pillar as part of the frame of the window but its not ideal.

Floor plan: [top-down view of floorplan](https://i.imgur.com/bUh5zUp.png)

**Thoughts and notes on individual positions**

D has a large lamp in that corner which would occlude several angles if I mount it in the deep corner. A potential alternative is on the same wall as D but on the corner between D and F, It could potentially have a larger viewing angle. Might still need to move the lamp though.

E seems like a solid choice that covers seating VR and the majority of movements for room-scale.

**My concrete ideas on placement with 3 lighthouses:**

- **E, A, D**: With ""A"" a couple of feet to the right to be more in the center of the room covering the back of the play area. E and D cover both from the front but might be redundant. Possible occlusion by spectators in front of A.
- **E, C, D**: A variation of the previous where I swap A and C. Having C in the corner above the window prevents reflections but also is guaranteed to no not have any occlusion issues. It would also allow me to mount E deeper in the corner above the desk making it a bit less visible and makes cable management easier.

Seems like 2 pixels right beside each other .
Left one is stuck on green, right one seems to be stuck on a dark purple like color, or dark red.

Anything i can maybe do about this? Or is my hmd slowly on it's way to it's grave?

Not quite sure if they are stuck or dead.

I noticed this thanks to my vrchat friends bright orange hair.

I can't see it on black, only when there is dome color going on on those pixels, how brighter the color is supposed to be, the more it can be seen.

Was hoping to maybe squeeze a bit more life out of this hmd while saving up for either a Vive Pro HMD or Valve Index HMD. (Buying the Valve Index Controllers for sure, soon.)",1574533091.0,1,2,129422

I have a few friends who now seem interested in VR and none of them are considering the Cosmos due to its horrific reviews and price or the Vive Pro due to expensive price. 

So it feels like the only true option in the market is the Oculus Riff S, Quest, or Index - and given the price of the Index, I would imagine most people would are going to purchase and  Oculus. 

I think HTC is leaving a lot of money on the table in the VR mid tier market. It’s the perfect starter build for people who eventually want to build up to a Valve Index and they could be cashing in on the excitement.

My main priority is to play some games like Beat saber/vr chat/some simulators but would be nice if I would be able to run something that will allow me to headpat anime girls/slime rancher/minecraft or maybe other more demanding games like nostos/fallout4 (if these will work on basic vive, not sure if googles make impact on preformance).

Vive,Temporary lighthouse mounting fixtures?,"Hi.

I've just moved in to a new flat (apartment) and it's substantially nicer than our old one where I could just about get away with having black wires running up the walls. My SO is (understandably) keen that we keep it looking pretty fancy, too, and all the walls are white. So basically I think this means I'm going to struggle to 'integrate' my Vive's lighthouses (mk.1) with this new place's decor.

As such, I'm trying to find a temporary method of having lighthouses in the living room space, but these also can't take up much floor space because there's, well, not much floor space to take up. **I've seen the tripod stands** that people use but those would take up so much floor space that my play space would be tiny, I think. 

My ideal solution would be something like a picture frame but with a tripod mount instead of a picture and subtle hooks on the walls to hang the frames on, but I wonder if there's another solution with repeatable 'zeroing' - maybe something with magnets? - so that I don't necessarily have to redo the SteamVR room setup every time I want to play.

Also, I know you're supposed to not have any reflective surfaces in your space but I'm just not going to take our art down every time I want to play something - is there a solution to that other than taking down the art every time I want to play something, or maybe some tricks with regards to positioning the lighthouses so that this matters less?

Vive,Left eye showing up in right lens,"Hi,
For a while now, I've been having trouble with my Vive. On more intensive games, such as Skyrim VR and VRChat (thanks to custom avatars), I've been getting times where my left eye's display will be shown in my right eye. I've tried all of the following in order to fix it:

-Replaced the cables between the link box and the HMD twice

-Replaced the HDMI cable between the link box and my GPU

-Directly connected my HMD to my computer without the link box

Has anyone else gotten this error? I've noticed that it only really happens on intensive games where reprojection is high. I'm going to try to fiddle with some settings and see if that fixes it, but in the event that that doesn't work, does anyone have any suggestions? It's gotten to the point where some games are unplayable due to me having to keep my right eye closed to avoid motion sickness/dizziness/disorientation.

Disconnecting and reconnecting the HDMI cable on the link box seems to fix it, but only for a short while.",1574391142.0,0,1,129422

This seems like a big deal to me and got me thinking about the handful of local asynchronous co-op titles in the VR world like [Late for Work](https://store.steampowered.com/app/623540/Late_For_Work/) and [Eye in the Sky](https://store.steampowered.com/app/566700/Eye_in_the_Sky/). Has anyone tried this feature out with these games or others like them? I wonder how well it works because I feel like this has the potential to be a big deal for VR and VR adoption. Similarly to how [VRChat](https://store.steampowered.com/app/438100/VRChat/) has gotten so many people interested in the tech by playing with people in VR and sharing in their experience, this seems like it might add that same value to those games that have chosen to focus on the local multiplayer party-style experiences.

And another question - I wear glasses, do have minus 3 vision it's called here, not sure of the measurement system in your country my dude. So is it possible to wear glasses and the vr helmet, or you can customise the lenses in the helmet so you'll have 100% vision. Hopefully it is so.

It is more severe when I look around. There is no improvement standing a foot from (either) sensor in the corner of the room. If the system isn't grey screening, then the perspective drifts.

Note that, although my initial setup reads as correctly aligned (the red cone almost parallel to the green cone in the attached) that is no longer the case, as it suddenly shifts. This is approximately 30 degrees off of true measurement. The sensors are also at the corners of the play space.

I've also tested each base station individually by placing it in A mode. The drifting is only present on the red one, but both have issues with grey screening.

Anyhow, I've always been an Intel guy, but I don't care about the wireless adapter. Just thinking about my budget and wanting to not go crazy with it.

Any recommendations for a new rig? I don't want to go over... say... $350? If I can help it. I'm thinking maybe $120 for a mobo, $150 for a CPU, $80 for RAM.

Vive,Could HL:Alyx be the first true Index controller specific showcase game?,"Unlike Oculus with the Touch controllers Valve didn't drop any full-sized launch titles that either required Index controllers or had real consequence in using Index controllers.

Imagine a point in the game where you you need to maintain a specific squeeze pressure, not too much, not too little. That would be less fun to pull off with analog grips/triggers on Oculus Touch controllers and no fun at all to pull off with the analog pad on a Vive Wand. Folks asked to play Aperture hand lab with Touch controllers so they did it - but it's not at all a equal experience.

&amp;#x200B;

If Valve doesn't create an AA+ game that makes owning an Index controller worth the cost in a truly demonstrable and ""game changing"" way that eclipses Touch - who will?

Vive,Vive Wireless Quick Tips,"Been using Wireless for about 600 hours now, here's some tips:

\- Be super careful when you rest your headset backwards you don't bend your power or Vive Pro AIO cable! For whatever reason they though it was a good idea to use long straight cables, which you can easily push against and potentially damage.

\- The USB Power cable get hot! The USB A-A cable provided is absolute garbage and broke within a week for me, but yourself a thick A-A cable and be aware if it gets too hot it can cause your headset to disconnect.  I personally recommend buying a right angle USB cable.

\- 3rd party batteries are generally pretty decent, most 10k Mah batteries tend to get unreliable once they hit 25% - Either get two 10k batteries or one 20k. I personally run one 20k Mah battery taped to my headset which lasts around 8-9 hours.

\- You need a good processor to run Wireless, it tanks CPU usage. Running Vive Pro on an 8 core 5Ghz idles VR around 34%! Ensure you're running either an overclocked quad core or 6 core processor to avoid issues.

\- Wireless does overheat, I'm in Australia and it get quite hot. I would just recommend either using AC, or cooling it with a mini fan when it gets hot. This doesn't apply as much to standard vive as it outputs less heat.",1574140859.0,6,1,129422

While Steam may have a lot more VR games overall, they're often MUCH smaller and have MUCH smaller budgets. Sure, I could just use ReVive, but it's not always a perfect match.

Vive,"Today is the last day to use GonzoVR, ever","After a little over a year on Steam, we're shutting down GonzoVR for good later today.

We had a blast talking to the people who checked it out, and I genuinely have friends that I met in GonzoVR that I'm closer to than my meatspace-friends.

It's certainly true that our user numbers were never very large, but in the end that wasn't the main issue. We always felt that the first priority was to create something that people really sustainably enjoyed, and once we had that we would then focus on getting more broadcasters and users. The big problem was that the kind of experience that everyone enjoyed the most: small broadcasts with 3-6 people, could never be economically valid for a broadcaster. We tried a few things to foster larger groups while still giving everyone a chance to talk, but there is only so much speaking time to be distributed. As soon as someone felt that they weren't contributing, they would leave.

We're making a new application now that builds off of what we've learned that people want, and the kinds of social groups that lead to the most enjoyable experiences.

Anyway, as a final note, I just want to say thank you to everyone who took the time to try GonzoVR out, and leave a review. People saying nice things about our work was what kept us going for as long as we did.",1574028486.0,80,12,129422

Vive,Got GTA 5 VR working without VorpX. Veryjos injection / grandtheftvr.com mod gameplay. Can it get finished?,"I am getting into the veryjos GTA 5 Open VR that came out in 2015 or so and I have to say just as an injection into the Vive headset is perfect. Comparing this with the VorpX injection, i'm blown away on this one just on it's out of the box nature to work well and not make me sick. It's unfortunate that it only gives you a set of guns, and a taster of the game (although the experience is still really good) because I want to play the whole game in VR. This mod is  geared towards usb racing wheel users, which is why I assume it was set up to be used with only one controller. What happened to this mod's progress? SOMEONE GET THIS GUY A JOB AT Rockstar. The story campaign would be playable (despite weird glitchy cut scene stuff) and also the game in general if both controllers were put to use. With one controller I have trouble aiming and continuing on a straight path. It feels weird compared to set ups like onward.  


Also, the [Grandtheftvr.com](https://Grandtheftvr.com) mod works without Vorpx using this Veryjos OpenVR alpha, my only gripe with that is that you can't shoot out of the car like in the veryjos version. Also my previous experience with this mod was using Vorpx, and it was severely sickening and low frames per second. Playing the [grandtheftvr.com](https://grandtheftvr.com) mod with the Veryjos injection is much much more playable, like native VR. I also like how the control scheme is set up, even if I have to use VoiceAttack to jump into and out of cars. I'm still working on my voice attack bindings, and i'm hoping to bind a lot of the switching character stuff, the thing about voice attack is figuring out how long each button needs to be pressed so it's been not working perfectly. That's my fault though, as i said.  


What's weird is that after launching the grandtheftvr mod with the numpad, I decided to hit L and launch the Veryjos mod, and to my surprise I had a gun in each hand and could shoot both of them. Only when I moved away I noticed that veryjos mod gun was dragging behind and pointing towards me instead of where the controller was pointing. It's totally unplayable like this just to mention.  


I was going to buy myself a usb racing wheel so that I could hopefully get that working with the grandtheftvr mod (with more mods). I know it works in the veryjos mod and i'll give that a go as well, but i'm looking to do the campaign. I think if shooting a gun out of your car was added to the grandtheftvr mod then it would be totally playable with voice attack no problem because it runs great and the VR view just gives you a weird perspective during cut scenes. and you can't see the map unless you system button out to desktop view. but yeah no gun in car and you can't shoot the folks during the boat highway chase, ect.   


Is it me or can you not shoot the gun out of the car in the grandtheftvr mod? Maybe since i'm not using vorpx i'm missing a function? idk. You decide. Let know in the comments below. It would be nice if someone could fix these two mods up into a working mod, possible?",1573973008.0,50,18,129422

I tried switching the only functioning bluetooth dongle with a nonworking one on its (the one vive gives) hub thing.

This is very weird and frustrating to me, because when i connected the dongles directly through usb without the hubs, it shows in the ""bluetooth and other devices"" that i have 3 connected ""Watchman dongle"" so clearly they work?

So then why do the trackers not connect to them no matter what i do and how much i pair, and only stay with the blue light on?

I was looking at picking up a VR headset and was originally going to get the OG Vive as I had tried it out previously and really enjoyed it.

Got the  first htc vive with no deluxe audio and with the vive ugly wands.

Sadly....valve dont want my money so i cant buy a index in canada...but is the vive comos worth it? got a lot of comments about the rift or the quest as a better choice.

Vive,"So, is Vive lip tracker going to be a thing?","I recently started using the Vive Pro Eye in Neos for eye-tracking and the hardware for it is amazingly accurate. It tracks the eyelid, eye, and pupil movements. I'd love to see something for the rest of the face. 

Today, I noticed in the software about section for the tracking something interesting. There is a mention of a lip camera version. I was thinking maybe we could see this as an addon in the near future.

These items are permanent,  and are used to power up your character in many ways. For example  between sessions you can combine weapons to create stronger versions.  You can also use coins to buy health power ups.

Your  level will reset after each play but items and weapons will carry over.  You can carry up to four items / weapons into battle. Below is a link  to the full press release and screenshots. Do let me know what you  think!

Vive,Dement Demo Now Available,"Hello everyone!

We are pleased to announce the demo for Dement is now available. 

[https://store.steampowered.com/app/1022990/Dement/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1022990/Dement/)

&amp;#x200B;

What is Dement?

Dement is an open world survival horror game that has been in development for three years, and is available in early access now. Currently, the game has four of eight chapters, with most of the open world available. Throughout the early access period, we intend to pepper in new areas, weapons, and side quests while we continue to toil on getting the last four chapters done- and of course, fix any and all reported bugs. Purchase now and you will get access to ALL Dement content in the future, and be able to participate in the early access period. Suggestions are welcome; some have been made and already implemented!

&amp;#x200B;

Who is Paracytik Entertainment?

Paracytik Entertainment consists of mainly two people; one coder/designer and one writer. We hope to one day grow into something bigger, and to bring rich, fulfilling experiences to players everywhere. We want to be a part of a better gaming industry- one that focuses on games as art, moving stories, and engaging gameplay.

&amp;#x200B;

What can I expect from the demo?

The demo skips the prologue, and is the first three quarters or so of the first chapter on a 45 minute timer. The main menu, tutorial, and loading screens do not count towards the 45 minutes. If you die, half of the time since your last save will be returned to you. The first melee and ranged weapon will be provided immediately to speed up initial play. Expect to spend at least an hour playing this demo! If you get to ""The End of the Road"", tweet us a screenshot @paracytik for a congratulatory shout out! Good luck ;)

I found plenty of listings online for single base stations (eBay, Vive store, Amazon, etc) but nothing for 2 base stations.

I just ordered a cosmos online, however I wasn’t privy to all this backlash circulating online regarding controller tracking, lowlight sensitivity. 

To anyone who owns this product, how are you liking it? Is it plagued with problems as described by some tech reviewers on YouTube? Or is this just a common hallmark of inside out tracking? I’m curious if people using the riftS or quest have similar issues regarding the controller tracking. 

Kinda wondering if I made a mistake , on paper the device sounded amazing. Either way I have a 90day return period if it doesn’t meet my quality standards. 

I am upgrading from the Rift CV1, so I’m hoping to see a massive improvement *fingers crossed*

I am super excited at the prospect of getting rid of the Fresnel lenses as they are the main source of my complaints with VR as a whole. Note that I can't afford to just upgrade to a better system as of yet, so that's not really an option.

I am looking at all the details involved and everything seems easy enough, but I have a couple questions about the 3D printed adapter that will be needed.

1: Is this still the best option for Gear VR (2016) to OG Vive adapter? :  [https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2837804](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2837804) 

2: If it is, which version would I be better off trying out, the fixed v3.3 or the adjustable v2.2 one?

Notes for 2: I do always use glasses with vive (as does my wife), but I don't know if it is necessary or even advised to go with the adjustable version. From the description, it appears that the maker still prefers the fixed version. I already feel like there's little to no room in the headset with my glasses and am hesitant to add anything extra in there.

3: Does the adjustable version need to be changed for each user, or is that a flat fix for the lens itself?

&amp;#x200B;

If anyone who has modded theirs and uses glasses can chime in, I would really appreciate a first hand accounting in regards to how the mod plays with glasses. Bonus points for anyone who shares the system with others with/without glasses to figure out how much of a pain changing settings are between users.

For those of you that own the regular Vive Pro or the Pro Eye version of the headset, I would like your opinions on a few things. Reviews aside, I'd really like to hear from typical users.

In your opinion, are the Pro Headsets worth an upgrade from the OG HTC Vive headset? (I'll either sell it to a friend or keep it for multiple users)

How's the audio quality of the speakers that come with the Vive Pro headsets? (I have the deluxe audio strap for my current Vive and the audio is pretty good on those) 

If you also use the Vive wireless adapter, were there any increase in latency or drops in performance?

Would 4 vive cosmos's work in this space? The issue then is I was planning to have a gun with vive tracker so then I am back to the original issue of tracking that, unless the cosmos can track vive trackers. I am also worried about how good the tracking would be with the Cosmos as well.

It was heaps cheaper than most of the others and it works really well. I need to train up a bit of muscle memory to get my left hand controller back to the right spot after changing mags but I could see I was getting better the more I did it.

Took 6 days to go from order to the UK and delivery to Australia and I've been poppin' sosigs ever since. :)

Vive,GrowRilla’s Next Content Update And Our First Reverse Sale," Hello everyone,

Salmi Games here. At the moment we are preparing for our next content update for our game [GrowRilla](https://store.steampowered.com/app/981880/GrowRilla_VR/). We don’t want to spoil anything just yet, but we have a [sneak peek](https://imgur.com/a/ZrJWkoM) of what you can expect.

With this update, we will raise the price of the game for the first time since we launched in Early Access a few months back. We’ve come to this decision after a lot of back and forth discussion internally, but in the end we feel $15/15€ price point more fairly reflects the value of our game than its original $10/10€.

The other thing we’ve tried to do (ever since our first VR game Late For Work) is to reward players who believed in us and took a chance on our games early in the process. If you supported us early, then you’ve gotten our games at their cheapest possible price. Thank you for your support! We appreciate everyone who’s tried one of our games, left a review or given us feedback.

So if you always wanted to buy the game (which you definitely did right) you can grab it now for $10/10€ or wait a week to get it for 15€! Think of it as a reverse sale.

Did we catch your attention even though you’ve never heard of our game before? You can find out more about our game [here](http://growrillagame.com/).

Thanks for reading. We are happy to answer any questions you may have in the comments.

Cheers,

Vive,Hope you redeemed your code more than a week ago if you pre-ordered the Vive Cosmos.,"I redeemed mine last Friday because I had accidentally paid for a month, and it only gave me 6 Months of Viveport. Here is the customer service response:

    Hi &lt;sirkha&gt;, 
    
    Thank you so much for the prompt reply. My name is Maria and it'll be my pleasure to follow up on your case.
    
    I can imagine this situation can be quite frustrating for you since you were not able to unlock the 12 months VIVEPORT subscription available for the VIVE Cosmos pre-ordered but let me explain to you a bit clearer the previous information. 
    
    I'd like you to think about the redeemable code as a key, a key you have to open a new code with specific features. According to your gift card, I can see you have the key available to use it until 12/21/2021, however, the subscription you unlock will depend on the current promotion you can see in our web page. 
    
    Since the 12 months code was available until 11/05/2019, all the codes redeemed after that date will unlock the present-date promotion, which at this time, is 6 months of VIVEPORT infinity. 
    
    I hope you've useful and clear this information and I'm sorry for the inconvenience. Nevertheless, if you need further assistance or if you have any questions or doubts, please don't hesitate in contacting us again, we will be here ready to help you with everything you might need. 
    
    Enjoy your coming week. 
    Sincerely,
    Maria

So does that mean you can subscribe for $5 a month and cancel anytime, or that its a year subscription, but the cost is $60 instead of $108?

Vive,Advanced Settings 4.0.0 we are in motion again.,"It's been a bit!
 
 
### **Due to safety concerns with how old OVRAS builds don't respond to SteamVR's new chaperone limits we can only recommend Version 4.0.0 at this point.**
This bears repeating. You could have chaperone misalignment with OVRAS 3.2.0 and older on the current SteamVR version. This majorly effects you if you like using our app for space-drag or especially re-directed walking.
Also, Valve changed some API keys, and now old versions will spam errors. This affects everyone.
 
**So now time for the good stuff?**
 
### What is this/Why do I care?
 Advanced Settings is an open-source free Dashboard overlay that is designed to give you access to many useful features.....
PTT, disabling chaperone, ""playspace mover"", ""floor fix"" among many many many many other features... see us on github at [OVRAS](https://github.com/OpenVR-Advanced-Settings/OpenVR-AdvancedSettings)
We try to develop and implement features that the wider vr community wants, (and is within reason XD)  hows our driv..... errr progress?
 
### HELP I HAVE ISSUES! or I just want to chat and ask questions.
 
We have a Discord at [https://discord.gg/vgvSkSk](https://discord.gg/vgvSkSk), can report issues there or help other people with issues
You can also post the issue directly on the Github @ [https://github.com/OpenVR-Advanced-Settings/OpenVR-AdvancedSettings](https://github.com/OpenVR-Advanced-Settings/OpenVR-AdvancedSettings)
As always you can leave your issues here I promise I look at them all.
 
### How Can I help!
 
Vr-er? - come join discord, report issues, test pre-releases, join the ritual to summon valve's flagship vr games!
Developer - come talk to us, do you want to add something.... assuming its within reasonable scope we probably would love to have it in!
Developer with lotsa free time - are you sure you don't want to re-vitalize input emulator it can do things we can't!
But Really what angle? honestly there is none, we love VR just like you all, and like providing the tool. If you really want to leave a donation you can donate to us individually [Kung's Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/join/kungvr), [Ykeara's Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/ykeara)
 
## Highlights of the update:
 
Motion should be fixed for all headsets!
Binding button to take you straight to the binding page
Color Control via gain. (index/vive/vive/pro) (this should have little to no performance penalty unllike overlay method)
offset profiles
pretty icons!
various optimizations.
 
Why 4.0.0 and not 3.3.0? - 4.0.0 is a breaking change, and as such certain old compatibilities will break specifically your old SuperSampling profiles, among some other items. **your keybinds will not be affected**
 
## [Download](https://github.com/OpenVR-Advanced-Settings/OpenVR-AdvancedSettings/releases)

Vive,Best Value Valve index combination?,"Hi,

I’m looking to buy a VR headset and I’m getting one later this year (Oculus Quest). I’m currently 13 years old and I’m gonna be getting a part time job in December (possibly earlier) next year at an IGA, which pays ~$10 AUD an hour, or at a McDonald’s, which from what I know pays ~$15 AUD an hour. All depending on which I may get hired for, if any. Since they aren’t the highest paying jobs, and that I’m also looking to build a PC around the same time, I’m wondering which combination of the valve index will be good for me. On the steam website, there are several different configurations. (Index, Controllers &amp; Lighthouses, Valve index and controllers only, Headset only, controllers only, lighthouses.)

I’m wondering, since the controllers and lighthouses work with the Vive, what configuration of it would be cheaper. 

Thanks!",1573469267.0,8,8,129422

Vive,Lag with hands extended out.,"Ok so this is an odd problem that i have had on and off for a LONG LONG TIME, but seems to have gotten worse recently.  


I just got the knuckles and they seem to be working great but this problem keeps coming up. Ill be playing just about any game, blade and sorcery, pavlov, or anything else standing. About 5 or 10 minutes into playing i will get a huge and i mean MASSIVE spike in lag. Unplayable. If i move my hands down to about my waist line the lag completely goes away.   


This is also accompanied by the steam menu acting oddly, by that i mean my right eye will blink on and off continuously as the whole menu is lagging severely.   


This is incredibly disorienting and ruins my experience quite quickly.   


Also it should be noted that when i play seated games like VTOL VR, i have no issue with this problem. It never surfaces.

Vive,Unpopular Opinion: I don't get the hype around Boneworks,"I am a fan of Stress Level Zero and I want to be hyped about this game. However, I am really confused on why everyone is so excited. I appreciate the amount of work that goes into creating proper physics in VR, but what about this game is more fun than the other VR games out there?

* The story seems like an afterthought, or at the very least we don't know enough to be hyped about it.
* Aside from destructible pieces of the environment, the combat doesn't look that different from other VR shooters out there.

For me a final game is about creating an cohesive experience for the end user, and from what I have seen it looks like they created an excellent physics engine for a game and then tacked on a game.

I want to be wrong, and I want to be excited. So r/Vive, change my mind...

**Edit:**

Based on the comments I now know the points below. It won't personally be a day 1 purchase for me, but I better understand why some people are excited.

\- This is exciting for people with knuckles controllers, so they can finally use them to their potential.  
\- There is still a lack of high quality VR games. So having a game with at least good physics is a step forward, and will encourage other devs to create these types of games.  
\- It will also have puzzles that use the physics.   
\- Combat options are more varied than I have seen... Though I still need to see what kind of crazy stuff I will be able to do.",1573251997.0,13,30,129422

Some players loved them and others just wanted to just keep busting ghosts. We decided to make this a separate optional challenge using a new system we're calling Relic Challenges. We just added it in the latest update which includes slightly re-balanced levels and additional types of these optional challenges to give players more variety in gameplay.

Vive,How The Scoring System Works In Pistol Whip,"When I first tried Pistol Whip at OC6, I was instantly addicted.

## Awesome Guns? Check. Great Rhythm Game mechanics? Check. Superpowers to dodge bullets and take on 100 people in 5 minutes? Check.

## All this wrapped into one epically stylized package that makes you feel badass like you’re John Wick when you play it? Check, check, check

The thing that stood out after playing it (for far too many hours the past couple weeks) was just how many layers of depth there is in it.

When you start out, you’re just learning how to shoot and dodge (basically trying to stay alive while you lament over how sore your legs are from doing so many squats dodging bullets), a little later, you learn how to shoot everything in time to the music and realize how great the flow is in the game, then finally, you learn the details of how scoring works and just go into this flow state each time you return to the game, partly making up your own rhythm each time you play.

Anyway, let’s jump right into how **scoring works** since the tutorial doesn’t cover some of these details.

The game initially ships with 30 leaderboards (10 maps with 3 difficulty leaderboards each).

## 1. Shooting

The aim of the game is accuracy and rhythm (besides Pistol Whips obviously, we’ll get to that). You can get up to 200 points per shot if it’s both:

1. **On beat to the song** (this gives 100 points)
2. **Accurate** (has to hit the enemy anywhere on their body, giving another 100 points)

**a. Accuracy**

By default, there is an “aim assist” activated. Turn this off and you’ll realize just how bad of a shot you are. Even though you may kill enemies if you have bad aim with aim assist on and get *some* points, you’ll still only get full points if your aim was close enough to still hit them.

With a maximum of 100 points, the scoring with aim assist on is calculated by “how much aim assist was needed to help you still hit your target?” This means that you can still kill an enemy with a poor shot (with aim assist’s help) and only get a couple points for your accuracy score.

**b. Timing**

Like most rhythm games, timing is extremely important, giving you half of the possible points from a shot. Unlike other rhythm games like Audica that shows exactly where to shoot and when though, you as the player are responsible for who / where to shoot and when.

When you first start playing, if your gun bullets were a percussion instrument, you’d probably get kicked out of the band. Later, you start to wonder why every band doesn’t have a “pistol player.”

**c. Additional info related to timing**

I had to ask the developers for some of these details. Timing is 150ms for each eighth note — 75ms on either side of the beat. The game lets you follow the beat with a shot within an 8th note, regardless of whether it was technically within the on-beat window. This allows for syncopation and 16th notes and allows you to still get creative with making rhythms with your shots.

## 2. Pistol Whips

Pistol Whips are very satisfying to pull off, but can be challenging at the beginning. For those who don’t know, a pistol whip is when you bash an enemy with your gun (think doing a melee hit in Halo)

To pull off a pistol whip, you have to taunt an enemy in front of you to shoot at you, dodge it, then you’ll need to time how long you have before the enemy reloads and tries to shoot you again, taking him out before he does with a swift hit to the face with your gun.

Killing with a Pistol Whip has a velocity counter, so you get max points for a 4m/s floating average. If your swing has less speed, you’ll earn less points, exponentially. Basically, pretend like the enemy is a Beat Saber block and you’ll be good.

**Why exactly would you want to do a pistol whip, it sounds riskier?** It is in some ways, but it has a payoff. Basically, a pistol whip is one of the easiest ways to guarantee maximum points from killing an enemy. Most likely, if you pistol whip a 4-shot-to-kill enemy with a bit of force, you’ll get 800 points (almost guaranteed, as long as you didn’t shoot them yet). If you shoot a 4 hit enemy twice before doing a pistol whip, you’ll only be able to get the leftover full 400 points with the pistol whip.

One last benefit of a pistol whip is that it reloads your gun and restores your full health. You don’t get additional points (beyond what you’d get if you had perfect shots), but the number of pistol whips you did in a level is also recorded for bragging rights at the end of a song.

## 3. Enemy Types

There’s 3 types of enemies in Pistol Whip.

**1 shot to kill baddies** – These give a maximum of 200 points

**2 shots to kill baddies** – These give a maximum of 400 points

**4 shots to kill baddies** – These give up to 800 points (either with a single pistol whip or 4 shots that all hit their target)

## 4. Modifiers

Modifiers are great ways to change up your gameplay and can allow you to get even higher scores if you disable aim assistant (and also have great aim). You can open up the modifier menu to see more about each one of these and how they affect your score. I’ll try to add some more details on that soon here.

So that pretty much sums up the scoring!

A few last FAQ:

## Are there mods and custom maps?

Not yet, but the devs have a lot of ideas for this and said they’ll make an announcement in a couple weeks at what that could possibly look like. A Beat Saber modeler Sir Raynor helped me mod in a new gun and got their full blessing to do so. New songs are entirely possible, but are a little complicated since there’s a whole level custom created around the song. I could still see a few ways this could work well and I’m excited to hear what the devs announce about it in a couple weeks.

Anyway, hope this was helpful. See you on the leaderboards!

Vive,"Vive HMD not displaying anything, SteamVR losing base stations, help please.","Here's what's happening, also, it's normal for the in game HMD position to be that low, since the base stations are moved from where they usually are. Also I'm aware that it's saying base station drivers are out of date, that's because I flashed it to factory drivers while troubleshooting, that's what those 3 things on the desktop are. Also, I only have one base station plugged in in the recording, because it wouldn't have mattered, the same thing happens at the exact same time as the other one: https://streamable.com/kt323

Things I have done during troubleshooting:

* Disconnected then reconnected

* uninstalled/reinstalled USB drivers

* Completely unplugged everything, including from the link box, then uninstalled and reinstalled USB drivers again.

* swapping out the HDMI cable from the link box

* Running Steam and SteamVR as admin

* power cycling the link box

* I tried directly connecting base stations via USB to check for firmware

* Testing it on my spare laptop that has never had steamVR ever installed on it before to see if it was a driver issue on my PC (Same problem on spare laptop)

* Making sure the things were plugged in on both ends

* Restarted PC after USB driver reinstall, several times

* Reinstalling SteamVR

* Switching to SteamVR Beta (and back again after that didn't work)

* Verifying integrity of the tool cache

* Power cycling base stations

* Directly connecting the HDMI to my PC

* Switching to Direct Mode

* Turning off vive camera

* Turning off Bluetooth

* Closing discord

* Uninstalling OpenVR advanced settings

* Deleting steamVR stuff from appdata for a truly fresh reinstall

* Buying an entirely new 3 in 1 cable after troubleshooting it and not getting any display from the old one's HDMI after plugging my spare laptop into a TV (still same problem)

* Connecting my vive directly to the back of my PC with the HDMI and USB on it sans the power connected to the linkbox which is *required* for power supplying

* Swearing a lot in frustration

What perplexes me is that my HMD is tracking for a set amount of time, but no in headset display is happening. The light on my Vive HMD is green till I turn on SteamVR then it's red. My base station top light remains green even after the crash, which means I can't troubleshoot if it's a base station problem since I literally went as far as to flash the firmware back to factory defaults in case there was a corruption happening and that still didn't fix it. What perplexes me even more is that the same exact problem happened on my spare VR ready laptop despite never plugging my headset into it before ever before now, which means it shouldn't be a driver corruption issue on my desktop I don't think. 

Another thing is that even though my controllers that are wireless, they get straight up disconnected in the short period it takes for the SteamVR viewport to cut out. Based on the desktop viewport of SteamVR they tracked just fine before getting kicked out of the system too; The lights on them go from green to blue in about the same time it takes for steamVR to soft crash, and they get disconnected permanently from this. Happened on both my valve index controllers *and* my vive wands.

Chatting to customer service is like non existent and they keep replying "" we are waiting for confirmation from warehouse"". Anyone returned their cosmos ? If so how long did it take to be refunded.

BEWARE: i will stay well clear of that headset . Not only is the product poor, but the customer service is atrocious to say the least. Never again would i buy anything from HTC

EDIT : So 5+  weeks later still waiting and not a single word from customer service. This to me is pure theft as I have returned their product. Next for me is legal action this has to stop and cant keep going like this . if i was the exception then cool .

Vive,Anyone know where to get thin face gaskets?,"Hello fellow Vivers,

I have a Vive Pro and although I swapped out the face gasket for a comfortable PU pleather gasket, I'm interested in getting the best FOV as possible by getting my eyes nice and close to the lenses. I've found that I can crank the tightness right up to get it fairly snug without any headaches but I feel that if the face gasket were thinner yet, I'd be able to crank out a few more degrees FOV.

Can anyone make some recommendations for really skinny gaskets? TIA.",1573131219.0,25,12,129422

Vive,Short Extension - Vive,"Hi Folks,

Currently have my computer in my computer room with my Vive in my VR room with a pass through on the wall to connect my headset. The cords have always been long enough and I’ve had no issues. Recently I’ve moved my computer to the opposite end of my desk and now the HDMI and the USB are about 3 ft too short to reach my computer. What’s the best solution to extending these cables? I’ve read people are using powered cables but that’s usually for much longer extensions ? (25ft extra)  Can I get away with just a regular extender for these cords?",1573190406.0,1,2,129422

Vive,HTC Cosmos: Lighthouse tracking of controllers?,"I have a Vive Cosmos and a Vive (original). Cosmos quality is excellent. Headset tracking is really really good, far better than Windows inside-out tracking - probably due to more cameras.  However, CONTROLLERS are lost on the games that matter (Beat Saber, RecRoom, even SongBeater). It's frustrating to know you hit a block/sphere or tossed a grenade perfectly, per the original, except for Cosmos losing it unless you are inside 50 degrees of center visual.

I know that, in February, the Cosmos will have an additional $200ish add-on for sale that allows the HEADSET to be seen by the Lighthouses, but the REAL need is for the controllers to be seen by lighthouses.

Q: Are there ANY plans, or even hacks, to improve the controllers, even by lighthouse?",1573153022.0,6,23,129422
Vive,Vive Pro wireless - wired; daily conversion solution,"Hey there,

I've been looking for a solution here several times but as the Pistol Whip release is within few hours the issue is highly relevant to me again.

I swallowed the high price of the Vive Pro and then the even higher price (in comparision) for the wireless module plus adapter ( both original HTC). While performance and picture quality is good enough for me for the typical roomscale game, the FPS and picture quality (flickering, artifacts) using wireless while flying Flightsims (DCS etc) was too bad while at the same time wireless isnt really needed. So I converted my HMD back to wired many weeks ago. 

This way I completley stopped playing roomscale games like Blade and Sorcery. However, there must be a solution where I can simply use my Headset in wired more. Power is not the problem. I would even use power bank while video is wired. However, I havent found a cable +  adapter solution for quickly changing to video via HDMI or DP without opening my HMD (it'll break one day).

Any hints?",1573137660.0,11,12,129422

Vive,Modders have once again SAVED Skyrim! 3 essential VR mods...,"For the unaware, some essential modding has resulted in Skyrim VR actually becoming a really decent VR title. I made this video so you can see...

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jap72TIhgDI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jap72TIhgDI)

The video features a full IK player avatar (painfully missing from the original game), allowing you to see yourself in armor (WTF was this missing from the game Bethesda!?!?!), and voice recognition for the real-time selection of spells and dialogue options.

All three of these mods all but eliminate the constant need to pause the game to access GUI elements, destroying your precious IMMERSION!

VRIK PLAYER AVATAR [https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23416](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23416)

The biggest hole in the original game fixed by modders! Providing  incredible immersion to the player by displaying a first person player  avatar that moves in sync with the players movements, with a full  inverse kinematic upper torso. Comes complete with a 3rd person vanity  mode, displays any armor the player chooses to equip, any race or gender  the player chooses to be, and also featuring the ESSENTIAL  FUNCTIONALITY with a 14 slot fully customisable holster system. Store  and retrieve weapons and tools from almost any position on your in game  body!

WAY OF THE VOICE [https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/16379](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/16379)

Allows for the unlocking and selection of any of the vanilla spells  using VOICE RECOGNITION, further freeing you from the immersion-breaking  torture of the Skyrim GUI.

DRAGONBORN SPEAKS NATURALLY [https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/16514](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/16514)

Speak to any NPC in Skyrim with your own voice, participate in the game  like its a MOVIE by READING THE LINES OF THE SCRIPT! This mod knows  which choice you want by voice recognition. As a bonus effect Way Of The  Voice mod also gains from increased responsiveness if you also install  this mod!

So... if you own Skyrim VR I would highly advise you check out these mods and install them... you'd be doing yourself a big favour!

More information can always be found at /r/skyrimvr , thats where I found out!

Thanks! Message me if you need help or have questions! And have fun!

Vive,Battle Dome is still fun to play if you can schedule 10 players,"So we hold a party last night with  around 10 players，we tried to play some popular games like beat saber and Pavlov together but the gap between skill level is so much. 

We have beat saber player who compete on world leaderboard with players who can't finish expert level songs; we have decent Pavlov player with player who are not into shooting game but can beat anyone in tactic games. We can hardly get a balanced PVP game until we tried battle dome.  For co-op games the maxium number I know is Zomday for 8 players.

The game with CTF mode and color map makes every player contribute to its team even if he's not good at shooting. (In color map, player can only teleport to the painted tiles with their team color. Player can paint the block with a paint gun but then they can't use any powerful two handed weapon) We played for 10+ rounds and everyone felt involved.

So, the last time I used vr was on the GEARVR on my old Samsung phone, I never used vr on pc. and I wanted to ask:

1. In general, for 300$, it worth to buy the cosmos even with all the problems (which probably will be fixed in the future, right?)?
2. the problems that everyone talks about is only on games? or it will be effect me even if i will watch a movie?
3. When i watching a movie, can i do that from any distance i want to or i need to stay close to the pc? there is a distance limitations?

This has the potential to be a killer app and best Karaoke app ever because it puts you on stage singing in front of a huge crowd and it's polished and looks good.

But there's one huge flaw...the audio is garbage.  There's no spatial audio or anything which just kills the immersion.  The game is 2 years old so most likely dead but it's so close to greatness that
maybe if we put enough pressure on the devs they will fix it.

I then unplugged all the cables and tested both the HDMI cables on my PS4 to my TV, both cable worked, I can see my PS4 contents displayed on the TV

The Vive Pro would be far more perfect if there was more space for the nose - if i move the googles outside (like for people who use glasses) i get too much tunnel vision and its not really enjoyable.

Vive,Is there a way to hide or disable the IPD?,"Recently my Vive began to have an issue where if I shook my headset with any kind of force, the IPD would show up as if I were turning the knob. I have messed with the knob so I know it's not just on the cusp of two different settings. It seems like it might be a hardware issue with something loose, but it shouldn't be that big of a deal if I can simply hide or disable the popup message.

I have already tried going to the 'ipdvalue.css' file and editing as many old posts mention as a solution, but there are a couple of weird things.

1. That file didn't exist until I made it, using this link's version of the file: [GitHub](https://gist.github.com/deprecatedcoder/74e65d0d320976f500c533401e9d51a5)
2. Nothing happened when I put it into what I believe is the right spot:  
C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\SteamVR\\content\\panorama\\styles

Does anyone have any ideas on how to fix this? None of the changes I make in that file have any affect on the IPD when it pops up. It's making games pretty much unplayable.

SOLUTION: Courtesy of /r/elvissteinjr

Navigate to: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\SteamVR\resources\webinterface\dashboard\css\systemui.css

Find '.IPDParent' and add: 'display: none;' to it. And that's all there is to it!",1572996106.0,6,19,129422

If anyone is looking at this you have to go into your stream config folder and delete steamvr.vrsettings whole SteamVR is not running. (I’d make a backup somewhere just in case things get screwed up)

Start StramVR and it should reset everything. The only thing is that all your settings including base station power management and controller bindings will get re-set. So make sure you save your controller bindings and remember what your settings are before you do this.

Is it normal to have CPU frame times over 14 Ms on Project Cars 2, for example, even while CPU load is at 40-60% according to fpsVR? It feels like I'm getting performance issues in games despite there apparently being room for the CPU to work harder.

My BIOS settings seem fine, as all the values it detects are accurate, and everything is set to auto. GPU driver is updated. I have no idea what's going wrong. I shouldn't have issues holding 90 fps on a Vive.

Vive,Occasional tracking issues with Index controllers?,"I use lighthouses 1.0, a Pimax 5K+ and Index (Indices?) controllers.

I never had a single tracking problem with Vive wands, 5-stars 100% perfect across the board even on Beat Saber Expert+. Index controllers work fine *for a while*, then eventually become erratic for... a random amount of time.

I used to use Windows 7 and could not install the latest PiTools, but I eventually bit the bullet and downgraded to Windows 10 on a separate HD just to test this. I was thus able to install latest version (1.0.0.180).

The situation improved, but it's not 100% perfect yet. I played Surv1v3 for about an hour, and after about 30 minutes the tracking became so erratic I could not hold a weapon in both hands; going back to the menu and selecting another game mode somehow fixed it.

**QUESTION**

Does anyone else has tracking with Index controllers but not with Vive wands? Is there any way at all to troubleshoot this?

At this point, I suspect that the Pimax headset itself, and more precisely the bluetooth bandwidth with the controllers, could be the reason of this problem.",1572951355.0,6,0,129422

VR E-Sports is missing competitive MOBA games and Cradle of Sins is aspiring to be one. From the early days of developing, we have been working with competing VR gamers who are also taking part in our Alpha testing in order to help shape the game. 

We wish to bring Something that is polished and has a proven track record – a good game that people want to play and will keep playing after weeks of release. We have approached the game with a community first mentality. This has proven successful as we continuously receive constructive feedback from our closed Discord group. They truly have helped us shape the game into what it is today. 

We're about to release the **Official Gameplay trailer** in a couple of days. Made by David Williams (ddubb) and soundtrack composed by an award winning film composer Simone Cilio.

We've recently upgraded our Vive Pro with the wireless kit. So far connection and framerate and picture-quality are as advertised and there's no difference to a wired Vive Pro.

Vive,"None of my ""extra"" dashboard tabs (Advanced Settings, Revive, and Viveport) work anymore.","It's been a few days since I last tried using any of them. I've been doing dev work, so I disabled the chaperone. I'm testing out a new video card I got recently, and tried to disable the chaperone, only to find that the tab is empty. Uninstalling and reinstalling didn't help.

I was ultimately able to re-enable the chaperone by editing steamvr.vrsettings in the Steam install directory and setting CollisionBoundsFadeDistance back to 0.7, which seems to be the default, but I still have the problem of the 3 tabs being empty.

The only thing that's different on my PC since the last time I tried using those tabs is the video card I installed earlier today. It only has 1 HDMI port, so I gave it to the Vive, since I don't have any DisplayPort adapters. I plugged both of my monitors into the motherboard to use the integrated graphics card.

I have a DisplayPort to HDMI cable arriving in a few days, so I'll know for sure if that's the problem, but is there anything else I might be able to do to get these tabs to work, if that isn't the solution? It seems pretty odd for 3rd-party SteamVR dashboard tabs not to work if there are no monitors plugged into the discrete graphics card.

Edit: I tried playing Project Cars 2. The game refused to display in VR. When I started a race, I could look at the game responding to the headset's motion, but the VR view wouldn't actually show up in the headset, and I saw a warning pop up on the SteamVR app saying to plug the headset into the same video card as the primary monitor.

H3VR doesn't have this problem, though, so... bad programming?

Edit 2: fpsVR's tab works fine, also. I'm really thinking this has something to do with some code trying to target a specific GPU or display somehow, and getting screwy when the assumption that the monitor and headset are plugged into the same card turns out to be false. I'll find out when I get an adapter tomorrow.

Edit 3: Plugging my main monitor into the same GPU as the headset, rather than the motherboard, by using an HDMI to Display port adapter fixed all the empty tabs as well as PCars 1 and 2. I don't understand it, but I accept it.",1572852986.0,18,9,129422

Vive,Any OBS tips for VR streaming setup? (Want to avoid frame skipping lag),"So I have my non-vr setup dialed in pretty well so that it doesn't frameskip (Different from dropping frames or lagging) by keeping about 5% of the GPU overhead available to OBS at any given time when streaming. I'm worried that moving to VR is going to tank the GPU though, and assuming I'll need to redo my setup to get decent quality. Here's where I'm currently at:

* Ryzen 1700x OC'd to 3.7ghz
* 1060 6gb OC'd to \~2115 GPU core &amp; \~4680 Mem Clock

SLOBS (Streamlabs obs ) @:

* Base canvas size 1080
* Scaled output 720 bicubic
* 48fps
* x264 CBR 4000 bitrate
* Cpu preset faster
* x264 options opencl=true
* Recording x264, cbr 8000, veryfast, nonscaled
* Slobs set at high priority cpu process

Now, I ***do*** have a vega 64, but I need to RMA it and get a 2060 super or a 5700 xt because it has some serious throttling problems at low resolutions and won't undervolt correctly. (Check my post history if you want to learn more.) So for now, that option is out.

Things I think I can do:

1. Switch to NVEC as the primary encoder to force SLOBS to prioritize the gpu before the game eats it up.
2. Change my x264 preset to veryfast

Things I'm afraid I might have to:

1. Switch to Regular OBS to free up some processor resources bc slobs is hungry
2. Drop the resolution of my local recordings
3. Change my canvas size
4. Edit: I forgot about the option [from my last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Vive/comments/9wgwni/twitch_streaming_problems_with_1060_i53570_slobs/) of using a second rig. I still have my i5 + 970 from last year laying around.
5. Edit 2: ~~Another crazy option - I could put the vega in the second pcie8x slot and dedicated to encoding?~~ I'm told this doesn't work.

Vive,Hey! Question about the wireless power bank!,"So I love my wireless Vive. It was so easy to setup and looks great, though admittedly my Rift S had a nicer display. Anyways, I've been looking into a solution for the low battery life. The issue I'm running into is that I have a 3D Printed holder that I bought that only fits batteries of the official sized ones. So I'm looking for something that is bigger in capacity but the same size as the original battery. Was wondering if anyone had found anything similar that would work. 

I understand it needs to be QC 3.0 to actually work with the Wireless adapter and so far, this is the best option I've found even though it's a bit pricy: [https://www.amazon.com/Grapheme-Wireless-Portable-20000mAh-High-Speed/dp/B07Y9S4WCY/ref=sr\_1\_12\_sspa?keywords=QC+3.0+power+bank&amp;qid=1572788852&amp;sr=8-12-spons&amp;psc=1&amp;spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEyU0w0NlM0SDhLWDFNJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwNjk3NzE3NjdPNkNCTE8yVDROJmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTAxNTg2NDMxNUJPUU5IVDQ2T1dVJndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfbXRmJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ==](https://www.amazon.com/Grapheme-Wireless-Portable-20000mAh-High-Speed/dp/B07Y9S4WCY/ref=sr_1_12_sspa?keywords=QC+3.0+power+bank&amp;qid=1572788852&amp;sr=8-12-spons&amp;psc=1&amp;spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEyU0w0NlM0SDhLWDFNJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwNjk3NzE3NjdPNkNCTE8yVDROJmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTAxNTg2NDMxNUJPUU5IVDQ2T1dVJndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfbXRmJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ==)

Vive,Play all retro games in VR,"Hi guys,

Some of you might see this as old news but only recently i found this and i guess that not everyone here found it already so i'd like to help you guys with how to get EmuVR. It's free btw.

 [http://www.emuvr.net/](http://www.emuvr.net/)  On the website are instruction to get to the download.

You can play all retro consoles on several old tv's, even old dos games, psx and much more. Just like in real life you have to connect the cables, plug in the game cassette or cd's, press the ON buttons, ... You can decorate your room with custom posters, wallpapers, floors, bedsheet, you can even add the pictures/logo's on the cassettes/cd's. It's really cool if you're a fan of retro games.

If you wanna figure out how to get everything working in emuvr i suggest you'd watch these short video's in the developer's playlist  [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLl8MHzvg8QAIALb8WNz-3ttdKfkMiBp-L](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLl8MHzvg8QAIALb8WNz-3ttdKfkMiBp-L) 

It took me quiet some time to put all the pictures on each cassette ect but here is my room in case you wanna see how my virtual room looks like :D [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=075FKPRMfTc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=075FKPRMfTc)

Vive,[Help!] Trackpad (not click related) registers constant touch.,"On one of my controllers, the trackpad registers a constant touch in the 10 o’clock position without my thumb touching it. It clicks down absolutely fine and any other input on the trackpad over rights it. In the SteamVR menu, where you can see you controller, there is a definite dot indicator on the trackpad in the same position.

Resetting the controller fixes problem for a few minutes then will come back a while after. Very annoying in games like Pavlov where it snaps direction and I end up spinning around in circles until I vomit onto my carpet.

Vive,Oculus Rift CV1 vs HTC Vive used?,"

So I really want to get into VR, and im thinking about getting a used rift or vive.
What do you guys suggest? I have never experienced vr before, should I get the rift or the vive? And what is a good price for it? Currently they seem to be going for around £450-499 new.
I found a used rift CV1 (marvel edition) for £180, and most of the used vives are around £200-300.

Thoughts?

Vive,HTC Vive Pre?,"Hi All,

Is there any functional difference between the HTC Vive and HTC Vive Pre? I found a really cheap HTC Vive on facebook marketplace (only 200$), the only difference I noticed between a regular Vive and this headset was the different power plugs, as these had european ones. The seller said he got it as a present from work 2 years ago, but never used it, and if I have any problem with it, he will take it back.

I bought it and brought it home now, and I noticed an HTC VIVE PRE label on the controllers. After a little googling, the only things I found out about the Pre are that they were made a few months before the regular ones for developers, but has the exact same specs as the regular vive. The headset and controllers really look like they were never used before, the base stations even have the foils still on, and there are some unopened bags with cables in the box. If this is functionally the same as a regular Vive, I would like to keep it, as I don't think I could get anything as good as this for a similar price. 

Do you know, if the base stations and controllers for the Pre are working same as the regular Vive? So can I upgrade to a Vive Pro or Pimax headset later, without needing to buy a pair of new base stations and controllers too?",1572656343.0,5,6,129422

However, after the setup downloads software and a setup guide (which is about as big as the software itself, smh), I get the following error:""Close Steam""""Confirm that you've closed the Steam client, and then click ""Continue"".

Steam is closed, nothing in the taskbar, nothing in task manager even when expanded to show all tasks.

As an extra precaution, I tried closing all Oculus software, Viveport, and a bunch of other things, but the message persists and whenever I click ""Continue"" it just comes back.

I tried restarting, I tried reinstalling Viveport, I even tried changing the name of my Steam folder in which SteamVR is already installed, so that setup would not be able to find any files (and presumably do a clean install), but it still gives the same error.

I spoke to a friend who had the same issue, even tried it on a machine on which Steam had never been installed, and he still got the error, but after a few days it went away and he could finally use the headset.

Vive,I bought my vive pro back after 3 months struggle with Index,"I sold my vive pro after I receive my index full set, I really like its controller(which made most revive games not only playable but enjoyable) and the audio is much more stable, no need to play with microphone or headphone setting in steamvr anymore. 

But, the LCD screen is a nightmare as I played Skyrim and Beat Saber most of the time. Black level is terrible no matter how I adjust brightness in steamvr setting. It makes everything unreal and blurry in certain games.  When I bought Index I thought it will only affect visual quality in some dark scene, but in reality even my steamvr home is quite blurry and washed out, Beat Saber felt even worse than my Quest. I thought I will get used to it someday since it did slightly improved visual quality in apps like Pavlov and virtual desktop, but I didn't. I almost burst into tear when I switch back to OLED screen yesterday.  It seems that when supersampling is higher than 1.5 on a 3K screen, the black level is more important than 50% extra subpixels provided by LCD screen. Although I have to admit that I didn't take advantage of Index's 120 Hz flash rate because I can only run my modded SkyrimVR at 90fps The Havok value has to be changed for 120Hz and it causes trouble. Also even with a 2080Ti graphic card and 8700K CPU, you cannot supersampling in most games while running at 120Hz refresh rate. If steamvr could have an option to run apps in different refresh rate, I may use 120Hz in some well optimized games like Superhot or Beat Saber.

I have a friend who also upgrade from Pro to Index, he's using a GTX1080(Supersampling at 1.1 at 90hz) and prefer to play shooting games like Pavlov. For him the Index is an upgrade on every aspects, whether is audio or visual quality. So it really depend on the game you play.

I will still keep my Index for local multiplayer on a second desktop (goodbye my old rift), but I will use Pro as my main headset at the moment.",1572568415.0,15,27,129422
Vive,HTC Vive - Single / Screen issue's [ Green 1 - 4 Pixels Sparkles / Green 1- 2 pixel wide lines / Flashing white with other colors ],"&amp;#x200B;

\- Ok let's start ( Problems/issues that are happening )

1. Green pixels sparkles popping up randomly around the screen ( Also might look like they are white ) ( Each one comes and goes with in less than a second ) their can be many of these or their can be very few of these
2. Thin Green line appearing near the middle of both screens leaving within less than a second happening way less often as the green sparkles do
3. Bottom part or full screen turn mostly white/ mixed a couple other coloured pixels ( most likely the game single still getting thru a little ) This last less than a second but can happen a couple of times in a row really fast and is not always their
4. Screen wicks out like your going cross eyed ( Stays like this intel you restart the headset ( turning off and turning back on steam Vr )

\------------------------------------------------------

Things that I have tried

* Unplugging and replugging all the cables ( HDMI, Power , USB ) have unplugged all and replugged all making sure they are clean - **No results**
* Checked cable for knots or damage that is visible - **Nothing**
* Made sure all connections are in good - **Nothing**
* Turning steam vr direct view mode off - **Stops number 3. from happening also mostly stoped green spakles and lines but not always**

Other notes all these problems are fixed or at least for the time By keeping SteamVr direct view mode turned off also ( maybe from the headset being warm( Thinking maybe the cold weather is acting it up room get really cold )) also when the cable is elevated ( Cable management ) Not sure going to try again

Problem Started 10/29/2019 - Came when playing Vrchat and got it to go away again 45 mins later and worked for the rest of the night

Problem continuous 10/30/2019 - Turned on problem is still their did testing to figure out what the issue is got it to go away with the stuff above - later tested turning Direct view mode back on did the same thing turned it back off it stopped

11/1/2019 Going to do more test maybe also buying a replacement 3 in 1 cable

\-------------------------------------

From what i have found and looked up over the internet, it seems like the 3 in 1 cable has a lot of issues ( did not know about this until I started researching a lot ) Something to do with the hdmi cable itself not being able to support it anymore and it has lost a single one of the hdmi line ( don't know what they are called ) so im going to buy a new 3 in 1 cable and also do further testing and update this more once the 3 in 1 cable comes i will test it and update and say if it fixed it or not

Ps. The problem happens in steam vr and other games also ( Pavlov , steam Vr , Vrchat ) for testing all do it again seems like a single issue or software issue

Vive,"Tea For God, new build (0.4.0)","Hi guys!

Finally, the first update that introduces new stuff to the gameplay. Following updates should be more often and probably I will be posting short videos with them (similar to the one that is posted here).

[First, check the video with the features.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRhpLvWiegc)

What's new?

Extension modules. These are the things you will be unlocking, finding and putting on your forearms to get better stats, more features, etc. Some of them will be just straight-forward upgrades. Some will upgrade one thing but will have side effects on others. Some will be more convenient but will take more place. For now, there is just a bunch that shows different types of EXMs. It is still a quite few of them and you may find filters on the left side useful. They don't look amazingly detailed but having a colour code for them and making it easier to read them without checking info was the priority. Boosters are round, active EXMs are grey, reactor is yellow, health is red and so on.

In this version, all EXMs are unlocked but soon I will be working on a persistence layer. But more on that later.

Extension modules fall into a few categories:

* boosters - they just improve stats
* passive - for now, this is just navigation and energy pulling (although energy pulling requires input). One of the things I want to add is ""auto-convert"" that will turn any nearby NPC that can be converted into your ally.
* active - here is where the most fun is as you use them during the game. You have to select them by pointing at them with your finger and then you activate with a button press.

And here's a short story behind one active EXM. There were a few people who said that Tea For God reminds them of Another World. I thought why shouldn't I add a shield that works in a very similar way to Another World's shield? So there it is (A/SHLD-S).

There are just five active EXMs now and as it comes to the functionality, these are just three types: attractor, deflector, shield. The attractor is useful to get the enemy's attention (or your robodog). The deflectors may render you untouchable. All incoming energy projectiles are deflected - they turn to not hit you. There are two deflectors: long-range and short-range. And finally, two shields. One that is bound to your hand, and other that you may place anywhere.

No, there is no tutorial but as soon as I feel that the core gameplay mechanisms are complete, I'd like to add some tutorial levels. With the final game, I am still considering whether to add tutorials into the game (which is good because you learn on the way, but bad because it may be distracting and you may not pay attention) or add them as something suggested when you die (then, the game would have to know what to suggest and why). The advantage of the latter is that you may experiment in the tutorials and learn stuff without any distractions around. One thing I am sure, I don't want to explain stuff with text - I'd like to get rid of ""learn basics"" as soon as possible.

There are so many things I'd love to throw into the game right now. I have dozens of ideas for levels, enemies, EXMs, weapon types, features (puzzle machines, the persistence layer which will include a few mini-games on its own). But I want to focus on the core gameplay and the content will have to wait a bit.

Oh, a word about the video. There is no commentary and it may seem to be rushed, especially in the first part. I just didn't want it to drag for too long. There are just glimpses of functionality and very short explanations with some of the stuff to discover on your own (like hot-cold navigation which I prefer). The video was taken using Vive (with tpcast) and Oculus Rift. With PCVR I added extra info on the screen (that was mostly to change the aspect ratio of the main view. But works nicely as a more inside view into the energy levels etc. Actually, I am now thinking about allowing someone else to sit at the keyboard to allow manipulating stuff (selecting EXMs, transferring energy, changing navigation targets (because that will be coming!)). This will alter your loadout as you may not require transfer buttons on your forearms and may have more stuff. Added that to todo list. Asymetric coop.

What else?

Have fun and let me know what you like, what you don't like, what would you like to have in the game.",1572271438.0,52,7,129422
Vive,Vive crashing since today,"For some reason launching SteamVR causes my PC to crash when my Vive is connected since this morning.

Vive,Updated reviews on prescription lens adapters?,"Hey folks.  Recently picked up a Vive and while it's manageable to wear my glasses while I play, it's not an ideal long gaming solution as I find the glasses occasionally get pushed into my eye and smudge.  I'd much rather go with one of the prescription lens adapter solutions that are out there.

Big question is, which one?  I've seen VR Lens Lab, vr-lens.eu, and WIDMOvr all reviewed and talked about, but nothing within the last year or two.  Curious to know how all 3 of these companies have adjusted to the reviews they've gotten and how they stack up against each other now.

Vive,Indie developed Monster Hunting VR Roguelike Game coming to Steam on October 30th - Monster Reapers VR,"Hey Everyone.

We're a two man indie developer team which has been working on a Monster Hunting VR Roguelike called Monster Reapers VR for a while now and it's about to release on steam early access.  
We started out wanting to make a game similar to Luigis Mansion, but we soon recognized even though the mechanics are fun, it wasn't enough to make a game that will be engaging for a long time.  
We started implementing Roguelike and dungeon crawling elements to make it more diverse and also spiced up the combat by adding new weapons and abilities.  
One hand will be your weapon hand and the other hand uses magic. It is heavily inspired by bioshock and we plan on also adding ways to use the elements to interact with environments and such.

Vive,Quality of Life Improvements.,"I'm slowly improving my Vive quality of life.  I've fixed several issues like my cable wrapping around itself in use, but I can't think of any way to make the Vive fit better.

I've adjusted the head piece as the instructions say and the Vive sits well on most slow gameplay, but game where I'm ducking or making fast movements the headset begins to slip and fall.

I'm funding myself throwing a hand up to reset the headset in place several times a song in beat saber and it's beginning to be a major annoyance and potential hazard to the system.  I'm assuming the cause is the back strap sitting at the back top of my head while worn instead of lower down like most masks.

I’ve been wondering if I could use a thunderbolt connection for the problem, but still not sure how. Any advice would be appreciated.",1572334694.0,1,4,129422

Vive,DETAILED GUIDE: Half-Life 2 Campaign in VR (via Garry's Mod),"**Introduction:** 

* Recently I played through Lambda1VR (HL1) on Quest, and loved it. As soon as I finished, I wanted to continue in to HL2. This was the best method I found, and I’m happy to say that I **loved** it! It was a fantastic, epic experience, even with all the technical and configuration challenges. 
* Would highly recommend it to any serious fans. Turns out the gravity gun is pretty fun in VR – who knew. 
* I probably spent about 12-15 hours in the campaign, and another 5 or so hours messing around with stuff to get it working. 
* This guide is intended to reduce the time you spend messing around, so that you can get more time in the game and complete Half-Life 2 completely in Virtual Reality. 

**Requirements:** 

* Garry’s Mod + HL2 in Steam – Garry’s Mod was a cheap $12 for me, though I have no interest in it other than for this application. 
* VR Legs / Iron Stomach – I don’t ever feel sick, but there are some moments here that will **test you**. The airboat is the biggest offender by far, but I think there may have been a few other moments that I can’t specifically recall – **be cautious if you are prone to sickness, and consider leaving this for when your VR legs improve.**
* Patience – The game plays through from start to finish more or less perfectly, but this is an enthusiast/diehard experience and completely unfit for people who aren’t willing to roll their sleeves up. 

**How to Install / Play:**

1. Make sure you have Half-Life 2 and Garry’s Mod installed on Steam.
2. Navigate to the Workshop for Garry’s Mod and install “VRMod - Experimental Virtual Reality” and “Half-Life 2 Campaign Content” mods. (note: I’m not sure if the campaign content mod is strictly necessary).
3. Enable DSR Super-Sampling through your [NVIDIA Control Panel 3d Settings](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/dynamic-super-resolution-instantly-improves-your-games-with-4k-quality-graphics/) (DSR Factors – might as well click ‘em all as far as I can tell – this allows supersampling)
4. Launch Steam VR.
5. Launch Garry’s Mod (you will get a warning, disregard)
6. Increase the resolution in the Garry’s Mod Video menu. SteamVR resolution settings do not work – you must change them manually (how high you go depends on your video card. On a 1080Ti, I used 3325 horizontal.)
7. Start a new game and select HL2 from the options. 
8. If you are starting for the first time, choose d1\_trainstation\_01 – they are NOT in correct order, rather they are alphabetical. If you want pick up where you’ve left off, you can find the correct map order [**here**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Vive/Point%20Insertion)**.** (Note: it can be difficult to make out the text at very high resolutions, so you might want to get a feel for where your map is prior to increasing resolution). 
9. Choose start game. You will spawn with all the appropriate weapons for that map in the game, typically with a full clip and one extra per weapon. 
10. To activate VR, hold down **“Q”** on the keyboard – this will open the Garry’s Mod VR in-game menu. Navigate to the **“utilities”** section, and the “**VRMod”** entry will be at the bottom of the list. 
11. Make sure you check “Automatically load VR when you start a new map” (towards the bottom) so that you can skip this step in future sessions. You can also select HMD/Controller oriented movement, as well as a few others. Avoid the ‘world models’ for wepaons, they don’t work right. 
12. Click “Start VR” and enjoy Half-Life 2. 

I used the following [youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjmN9wt7h5Q&amp;feature=emb_title) to get myself started, so props to them and please consider viewing it if you are having trouble with any of the above steps. 

**There is NO Saving, so what happens when I die/quit?** 

if you die, you have two or three options, depending. 

1. **Restart:** If you really care about not cheating, the best bet is usually to fully exit gmod and restart at the beginning of whichever map you died on. Each map is relatively short, and this isn’t a significant problem. Just be cautious, take things slowly/seriously and you’ll be fine. You will lose your ammo as a penalty for death, but you are given enough at the start of the map to be able to make it comfortably. This can be a pain, but reloading the map without restarting often seems to break things (or did for me). 
2. **Respawn:** You can also respawn, but you will respawn in that same instance - with all the NPCs who were dead, still dead, etc. If a door opened in the beginning of the map, but is now closed, you might be barred from going through. You can noclip through and usually be fine though. If you want to emulate 'checkpoint saving' and dont care too much about the purity of your run, this is probably the simplest option to advance in the game. You will spawn without weapons, and so either need to pick them up in the map, or give them to yourself through the “Q” menu in Garry’s Mod. 
3. **Kill Key NPC:** Finally, if you happen to be accompanied by an important NPC, their death will be game over. When you respawn, this will be a clean level load for some reason and everything will work. So if something glitches and you want to start fresh, just kill Barney or Alyx with a combine ball, which is the most effective immediate KO. 

**Setting Up Controls:**

* Many of the default controls assume you are playing Garry’s Mod, and so the mapping can be improved. I used Vive Wands, and used this  [layout](https://imgur.com/a/BEPMzpH) , you can download my [SteamVR Input export](http://s000.tinyupload.com/index.php?file_id=23776465543963730812). It was also saved in the community bindings, but I have not been able to access those recently. Further note, I think my controls could be further improved for sure, so if anyone works on a better default, I will post theirs here. 
* If you’re using other controllers, my export isn’t working for you, and you’re not already familiar with SteamVR Input mapping, this is a good time to get your feet wet. You can basically rebind everything to your liking. 
* One input that is valuable for troubleshooting is the Garry’s Mod “Q” Menu. This is a menu that you want occasionally, but don’t need quick access to. I created a chord (left menu, left grip) to open this menu in the Steam Input Settings. 

**Control Tips:**

* **Using objects:** To “use” something, the 'action point' that determines whether you can activate something is at the end of the right hand - but not just the hand, its the model. If you have the empty hands/crowbar etc, the action point becomes the centre of your HMD. 
* **Flashlight:** Your flashlight will come out of your right hand as well. You will notice *significant* performance drops when the flashlight is on in some environments. I’m sure this can be tweaked or modified in the video settings. 
* **Aiming Melee/Grenades**: To aim crowbars and grenades, use your HMD - not your right hand. Don’t know why this is the case, but it is. The centre of the flashlight can help you to aim the crowbar. 
* **Aiming Guns:** For some guns, the iron sights are somewhat workable (i.e. pistol), on others (i.e. SMG) they’re not reliable. The combine gun doesn’t even have sights! Consider this a flavor-win…if you just picked up an alien gun, maybe it wouldn’t be setup with your ease of use in mind. That said, I found a consistent way to sight even the combine gun, and I’m sure you can too!
* **Who you talkin’ to?:** You may notice some of the NPC’s staring at the floor when they talk to you – that’s because they are talking to the end of your gun/right hand. You can solve this by either switching to empty hands/crowbar etc, or holding your gun’s barrel to your own face – or, as many of the game’s quirks, by ignoring and accepting this defect. 
* **Weapon Wheel:** If you're not familiar with the weapon wheel, it works by scrolling clockwise or counterclockwise to advance. It's not the best for large inventories, but honestly by the end I didn’t mind it. 
* **Ladders:** OK, so ladders seem crazy and almost made me tear my hair out – but actually, they work fine. also ladders are crazy. you will think they are incredibly broken and janky, but heres the process: you walk up and get your right hand in the proper distance to activate (if the activation point goes through the ladder, it wont work. Usually you can be pretty far from things, so err on the side of being farther away. AFTER YOU ACTIVATE THE LADDER, put both your hands in the air above your head.  You probably only need one of them, probbaly the right hand, or it might even be controller orientation,  but I always put my hands up and it worked everytime. To get off the ladder, 'use' it again. you'll almost always pop on to whatever surface you need to. 
* **Vehicles:** The Vehicles use their own separate bindings, and for the most part they work fine – but keep in mind, the mounted weapons are completely, irreparably broken. Do not bother trying to fix them, you can’t. The mounted weapon seems to have a fixed relative orientation. I.e. it’s relative to the world, not to you or your controllers. Also like three different inputs have an influence in the way they aim. I actually managed to defeat the helicopter in the airboat despite this, but It basically meant that you always had to attack from the same direction – hard to explain, but the long-story short is: forget about them and don’t waste two hours of your life like I did. 
* **Q Menu:** The “Q” Menu in Garry’s Mod allows you to give yourself weapons, change settings in the VRmod, and spawn items/objects. This can occasionally be useful to get around glitchy areas, give yourself a weapon after respawning, or others. 

**Places you** ***will*** **get stuck (spoilers):** 

There are several sections that are outright broken and require workarounds, but luckily I have already figured them all out for you. Here they are in order of appearance:

* **The Water Trap:** During the d1\_canals\_01a you will be going through a long tunnel when you will find a pool of water. It can be difficult to get out of this and continue on. I would guess that most people who brave this mod and quit, quit here. I spawned some extra boxes and pallets, and then used those to help me jump up. I think that if you ‘raise your arms’ above your head while you try to get out, it might work for the same reason it works on ladders. Last resort, open the console and ‘noclip’ to get up. 
* **Vehicle Combat:** The gun doesn’t reliably work on the airboat or the car. During **Route Kanal** you will need to destroy an attack helicopter. Just spawn yourself an RPG with the “Q” Menu. It is possible to kill it with the gun (I did it) but in retrospect I wish I had just cheated my way through. You never need the gun on the buggy, so just ignore it. 
* **Ravenholm:** d1\_town\_03 is actually several maps and I believe is the only instance in which you will ‘load’ into the same map, and not the next one. This confused me the first time. This makes it annoying as you have to do all the sections in one go (or else clip/cheat through). If you do decide to respawn/cheat through to get to your old position, you will have to trigger all the scenes with the old man who helps you, as the level will not progress if the scenes have not triggered. 
* **Alyx in City 17:** The map d3\_citadel\_6b, where you meet back up with Alyx, has messed up spawns. If you load in from the previous level, and don’t die during this chapter, then you won’t even notice. But if you start directly from this map, or if you try to respawn in any way, you will definitely notice. It seems to be spawning randomly (multiplayer spawns???) and you will have to noclip back to the very beginning of the level, and then proceed normally to trigger the cutscene with Alyx and continue from there. 
* **Super Gravity Gun:** When you load into d3\_citadel\_03, you will be stripped of your weapons but you will not receive the super gravity gun. You need to download an addon to get it then give it to yourself in the “Q” menu.  You might find that your aim is now attached to your HMD – this is because the gun will take its Aim orientation from whichever weapon you had last (i.e. HMD if crowbar/hands/grenades, Right hand if gun). So if you switch to it from the machine gun (should be able to find one on the first combines or in Q menu) it will go back to normal. You will also find that your gun model might now be screwed up – no fix for this that I’m aware of, but it won’t impact gameplay. I don’t recommend installing this addon until later, as it will clutter up your menu and can screw up gun models when it’s not necessary. 
* **Episode 1 / Episode 2:** They just don’t work. Sorry. I ended up playing them flat. Was disappointing! If anyone does know how to get them working for a full playthrough, please let me know!!!

Apologies if there are any errors (which I'm sure there are at least a couple). I will update to incorporate corrections/suggestions/better tips/etc as they come in from the comments.

In the meantime, for all the brave souls who choose to take on the Combine in City 17 - good luck",1575926331.0,152,21,129422

Vive,Highly recommend Onward for anyone who plays Pavlov and Contractors,"Just a headsup because I know a lot of people who play VR shooters don't play more than 1-2 games regularly, and I think a lot of people would like this. 

Onward, for those who don't know, is the most realistic shooter in VR and one of the big three (Pavlov, Onward, Contractors). The Devs are very intent on it being a realistic MilSim so you're not going to get TTT or anything too comical (although it does have RPGs, Drones, C4, and stun guns). But it also means the game's tension, gunplay, and personal physics are unmatched. The primary mode is based on search and destroy so you don't respawn, and the game is all about positioning, directional audio, and flanking. There are more guns and attachments and there are dedicated classes, and sniper mechanics are better with both aim and scope smoothing that reduces tracking and hand jitter without making the game too easy. There are side sights and hybrid scopes, and the game makes you balance your loadout points between different attachments, body armor, grenades, or pistols.

You can definitely play both this and Pavlov or Contractors, but if you play Pavlov and prefer playing pure combat modes like Search and Destroy then Onward is perfect for you. I played over 200 hours of Pavlov but Onward just feels a lot better for pure combat modes and no weapons feel OP or terrible. Maps are huge and spotting enemies and figuring out their spawn is a big part of it, which also makes sniper rifles really viable. When you compare just combat and gunplay Onward feels like Pavlov 2.0, even if it is less forgiving. I also do a lot more crouching and evading in this.

Onward has modded maps (no rules or mode mods), although because it was sold on the Oculus store as well they don't use steam workshop. This means mods are little bit of a pain to download right now but the game doesn't lean on mods as much as pavlov. Onward also has other modes like Gun Game, One in the Chamber, and Spec Ops, but those are only available in private lobbies if they aren't the ""social mode"" of the month. It also has higher hardware requirements but the graphics look better in my view, and things like lighting and shadows look better with very little text when you're in combat that distracts you by becoming pixelated at a distance. It has a single player/co op mode where you hunt or escape AI who are really hard, maybe too hard.

It gets updated a fair amount, new custom maps come out steadily, etc. A quest version is reportedly on the way but I have no idea how that will be. There is a dedicated community and around ten lobbies even after midnight, with a lot of Pacific and European players, and a recent sale boosted player numbers a lot.",1575888262.0,93,107,129422
Vive,Vive FOV Values: For Unity Shader (s),"Heya brothers and sisters! First time poster, long time lurker.

While working on a shader I needed the horizontal and vertical FOV values; the search lead me here.
I found a thread where people were looking for the same, but there was no answer, so I dug into Unity and found the internal values.

Horizonal FOV: 106.0971
Vertical FOV: 111.7577

Vive,Gorillaz Inspired VR Experience in Development - Help Us Bring it to Life!,"Hi, I'm Jake. I'm a VR developer from Sydney, Australia. Earlier this year I released my first music VR project INTERSTELLA VR - A Daft Punk inspired experience. Watch the video or download it here: [jakedonaldsonvr.com/interstellavr](http://jakedonaldsonvr.com/interstellavr).

It created waves on the internet and received a lot of media attention, including articles from [Road To VR](https://www.roadtovr.com/daft-punk-vr-one-more-time-fan/), [EDM.com](https://edm.com/news/daft-punk-vr), and [DJ Mag](https://djmag.com/news/daft-punk%E2%80%99s-%E2%80%98one-more-time%E2%80%99-has-been-turned-vr-rave-watch).

Next I'm looking to produce a no-budget **GORILLAZ** inspired VR project based on the music video for [FEEL GOOD INC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyHNuVaZJ-k). It will be an immersive, interactive experience to be played on 6DOF headsets, like Vive, Rift and (potentially) Quest.

Vive,VR Game Idea (Nowhere else to post?),"Hey, Recently I was quite bored. So I wrote up an entire VR game plot in 2 hours. Don't you just hate it when you write a game, I do. Anyway, my game ""idea"" is called Cube-ustry (Mashup of cube, and industry, corny I know.)

Quick run-down
You start in a white void, infront of you is a gray desk, and three cube shaped holes, (Each hole had a colored sticker next to it. Red, Green, and Blue.) behind you is a chute/dispenser that appears to stretch into infinity.

""Hello"" the narrator greets.

""Welcome to your workplace, please state your name out loud.""

*Player presumably says name*

""Just kidding, I don't actually care. Your Employee #002.""

*Fax machine like sound plays from behind you, as a red cube falls out*

""Please grab the RED Cube and place it into the RED slot.""

Two events will trigger base on different reactions

*If player puts the cube in the red slot* (String 1)

""Good Good, You got this.""

*Fax like sound plays again, a green cube falls out this time. You get prompted with the same message as before""

""Please grab the GREEN Cube and place it into the GREEN slot.""

*if player puts it in*

""Great! You've got the hang of things, i'm sure you can figure the next thing out.""

*Fax Sound plays, once again. And a blue cube falls out of the chute, and the narrator says nothing.*

That is the main story, here is an additional part. 


*If player doesn't do as asked, for any cube insertion*
(StringF)

""As I said, put the (cubenamewillvaluebasedonevent) cube in the (^) slot.""

*If ignored again*

""I am simply an automated response system, I have no problem repeating forever""

Message will just repeat from now on


*If player doesn't do as asked*
(String2)



Main story continues:

*If final cube is placed in, 'blue'*

""There you go. You've got this, im sure you don't need my help anymore. Good luck Employee #002!"" 

""Oh, and heres a little gift.""

*A opening becomes visible on the top of the board and an 4 digit counter, like the ones you see on a calculator or alarm clock pops out*

""The more you get right, the higher the counter goes to. Get one wrong, and you lose a point. You may get rewards for good preformance""

*A random colored cube spawns*

From now on, you just put cubes in and get higher scores, if you put one in you lose a point and the cube gets launched out of the slot.

(Any devs who are willing to attempt this game can add easter eggs at this point, like for example 1337 cubes might give you a computer or something. Just random stuff, you can honestly do whatever you want :)

(If you reach 9999 the counter should reset and the narrator should pop in a 
""Wow, thats alot of cubes! If you weren't a simulation I would have promoted you.""


ACT 2 (The accident)

Upon wandering too the back of console (the machine that you put cubes into) there's a red button with a glass case around it, this case only opens when you finish the tutorial, aka when he stops talking to you.

If the button gets pressed, the narrator will say:

""Oh no, you shouldn't have pressed that. Didn't I tell you not to press buttons? No? Oh, oops.""

*The chute dispenses a purple cube*

""Gah! Don't pick that up, leave it there. I'll fix this,  just give me a moment, DO NOT PUT IT IN THE SLOTS.""

*if player leaves it for like 10 seconds*

""There, I have re-routed the button controls. Press it again to remove the cube.""

If the player presses the button again, the cube will fade away with a pop and the random Random Red Green or Blue cubes will continue to spawn normally unless the button is pushed again.

*If button is pushed again the narrator will yell*

""Why did you press it again? I can't fix it now. Look what you've done now.""

*ACT 2 continues normally now*

If player puts the purple cube in any of the 3 slots, the counter will start to flick to random numbers and the white void you where in has now faded to a black.

""No, oh no. This isn't good at all, I better cut the simu-"" 

Narrator stops mid-sentence

""Nevermind, hey Employee #2 behind the console there should be a plug, would you pull it for me?""

*If player pulls it, all objects will disappear and you'll be left in a black void. But then the void turns back to white, and you are once again presented with the console, chute and the narrators welcome. (Plug doesn't show up untill red button is pressed.)

From then on the story will repeat, but address you as employee #003 instead of two. If you get to that point and reset the game again, it will go up a number, and so on. 

*If player doesn't pull the plug, the game will reset on its own, you'll be back in the white void with a fresh new console, but this time there is no narrator.*

-end, for now-

I know that wasn't much of a quick run down, more like 25% of the entire story. Basically you do different things for different endings, if this is added to steam each ending could be an achievement. If you lads think this is a good game idea I'll post a pastbin link with a more detailed story line including all the ending and somewhat thought of easter eggs, also this is heavily inspired by The Stanley Parable, if you didnt already notice.

Reference/Key for this mess: 

https://imgur.com/a/2PfdkFp - full album

I sent in a ticket because I ran out of options when trying to fix my base station with the blinking red light, got a swift caring response back walking me through some steps and clarifying some facts. Fast forward a few months as this sort of things stresses me, I finally get round to responding with the information required.

A few days later I'm given a tracking number and told to pack the base station and a controller (right side trackpad issue) and they'll ""take care of this"" for me. 
When there's a chance at getting money the customer service is nice and quick. [Picture 1](https://imgur.com/ORRpEqe) 

No later than the next day I've been asked to pay near £120 for the repairs, being told my base station is no longer under warranty when it is and my controller due to a scratch/white paint from my cupboard on the end of the circular sensor needing me to pay for the full body kit to be replaced. [Picture 2](https://imgur.com/99nY8oD) [Picture 3](https://imgur.com/LzGVpT1)

Wanting to take this one item at a time I ask about the base station because that was beyond confusing. I get an email completely making me relieved, right? [Picture 4](https://imgur.com/qaj7CRP)

No - I check the ticket numbers and its a conflicting statement. Ticket number ending in 82 is the controller, ending in 80 is the base station. Meaning they're repairiing the wrong device. [Picture 5](https://imgur.com/JhtBJNG) [Picture 6](https://imgur.com/g2ilDLs)

Now its near Christmas and I'm currently expecting to receive a controller in a week or so when it should be the base station as promised. I'm reaching out to them through email, trading standards &amp; twitter whilst communicating with others who have had a similar issue.

[Picture 7](https://imgur.com/gDyinmF) is just about the controller and how if I was to ask it would be rejected to waive the inspection fee and just return it to me.

Any help is appreciated!


EDIT: 09/12/2019

I'll include my email to them and the response I get from here on out, thanks @RustDragon for the fair point.

I've received [word](https://imgur.com/a/D4MVj0O) from Vive and it seems like good news regarding the base station, I'm assuming by 'fix this issue' it's an optimists dream that it's the controller they're fixing, so I'll need to work on getting it back as they've informed me they don't do partial repairs [here](https://imgur.com/a/9dueLvF)

TL;DR
HTC are refusing to give me my product that I paid for unless I give them more than half the repair fee just to receive it in the same condition as I sent it in.

My play space is literally the minimum size SteamVR will allow, however. I don’t need that much slack on the HMD side in order to move around, so it seems unlikely that I would get tangled.

Vive,Bring a real heavy bag in with Vive Pucks.,"My Family was playing BOXVR tonight (we also play thrill of the fight, with fun on the heavy bag and body dummy) and I was thinking if the **Vive puck** could be used not only to bring boxing gloves in but **what about an actual heavy bag**.

I think this could get away with just two pucks but would be further customized with four pucks (for gloves).

Thing to question first off, can a game be coded for this, it would need to be set up correctly in your space.  Pretty much specifically for the game but hey all Gym equipment, bags etc are anyhow.

• Could a heavy bag be brought in with a **Vive puck** on top and on the bottom back side with the base stations fixed to properly track and pucks secured, we know gloves can be brought in.

• Could the **coding account delivered bag weight as input options** to help with bag motion tracking?

• Could the bag while in game have a **visual overlay arcade point system** to score and maybe even rhythm (think top right and bottom right side \*Behind the bag has an affixed glow or flash indicator for a hook and circle indicators on the face of the bag for straights and jabs when called up).

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly, if this could be done it would be niche I know but **how awesome would it be to have something you could for the first time (as far as i know) actually feel a real life impact from while in VR and not a simulated impact**, really as far as I know it would be the first real world experience and actually could be done, right now!   Or does this seem far fetched?   I personally would set up a space just for this to try out myself if I could even code a game for it =\\

Vive,What has changed on the Original Vive since release?,"Another post was asking if buying a used original Vive headset was still worthwhile and a good introduction to VR. It had some good answers which helped me, but the questions I have now are a little different.

(Honestly you can probably skip the big wall of text here and just skip to the questions at the end. This is just background about why I am asking and is included to help you all provide better recommendations.)

Background: I have spent most of today watching and reading reviews on the various main brands of headsets, (Valve Index, HTC Vive, Vive Pro, Cosmos, and the Oculus Rift, Rift S, and Quest) and haven’t really gotten as close to a decision as I would have liked. At the very start, before watching any reviews, I was considering a Vive Pro because I could find “used” ones (minor cosmetic damage kind of used) for ~~~$500,~~ now seeing more like $700-$800 (I was probably remembering that price entirely wrong) but a lot of the reviews I have seen have made me realize that’s not really what I’m looking for. I don’t really want to go for an Oculus because Facebook owns them and I don’t want to support their rampant privacy invasion. That’s just a personal choice. I more recently have been considering a refurbished/used Vive from the Vive website (so technically “Certified, Pre-Owned”) which are only $400. I have played with a friend’s PlayStation VR and I enjoyed it, so I have no reason to believe I’ll hate VR entirely, but I’d rather not spend $1000 on an Index and then use it only a handful of times. I *could* afford it, but I’m just not comfortable spending that much when I don’t have much experience yet. The common opinion seems to be the Cosmos is garbage so I’m steering clear of that for now. I’m open to lesser known brands as long as the headset is still decent, but I have yet to really come across much on them other than they exist.

I intend to be using the headset with my PC (Windows), primarily for games. One I’m excited for at the moment would be Subnautica because that was a great game and will hopefully be a whole new experience in VR. I’ve got a good space that I think should well behind my desk.

A lot of the reviews on the original Vive that I have found are from 2016 and seem to be from around the time of release. Obviously things have changed since then, which brings us to...


*Question 1:*

What has changed and been fixed since release? What concerns of the reviews from release can I ignore?

*Question 2:*

Are there other headsets that you all recommend I look at?

*Question 3:*

In the aforementioned post, someone recommended the Samsung Odyssey Plus. I’ll be looking for reviews shortly but I wouldn’t mind some more input on it. Does anyone have experience with it and care to share?


And in general, any advice you can offer to help me on my search would be appreciated!

Edit for fixing some information, at to add another question:

*Question 4:*

How important is accurate tracking? What are the effects of inaccurate tracking? This keeps coming up in reviews and I realized I don’t understand yet what difference that actually makes. It’s one thing for your hand to “float away,” but is it really that bad to have it a few millimeters out of place?",1575787124.0,1,9,129422

Vive,So 1.0 hardware is compatible with Base stations 2.0 but 2.0 hardware isn't compatible with base stations 1.0? Is that correct?,"I'm a little confused. (editing for clarity because I butchered the title)

It seems that **v2 headsets and controllers** *are* compatible with **base stations 1.0**.

But **v2 basestations** are ***not*** compatible with **v1 headsets and controllers**?

Meaning, if I upgrade my base stations to v2 buy purchasing the index kit, they will **never** work with OG vive controllers, pucks, HMD etc?

Having forward compatibility but not backward compatibility seems, dumb to me. Maybe I'm reading this wrong.

Edit: ok so I'm not reading this wrong, Basically, if I upgrade to an index and EVER find myself in a situation where I want to go back to the old controllers, or maybe get a vive pro, I have to downgrade the base stations.

I noted that one application on the list has not yet been released, while another had been renamed from its earlier incarnation.  In addition, I've included Glycon Pro which is not sold through the Steam store, but instead is a utility for Motion Capture that supports the trackers.

I've recently added Sansar to my list after a fellow Redditor alerted me to its support (thank you)!  Without further adieu, my current list:

Vive,Vive Intermittent Fault - Loses Stereoscopic View,"My Vive (original) has developed a weird intermittent problem. It randomly stops displaying the image stereoscopically. Or else it suddenly decides to display completely the wrong projection for stereoscopic viewing.

It plays normally for maybe 10 or 20 minutes, then suddenly it'll decide to no longer display a stereoscopic image. Both eyes are rendered and both displays are on and working, but either both eyes are displaying the same image or the image is displayed in completely the wrong stereo projection and it becomes unviewable. If you close one eye it looks fine but not with two eyes.

If you put the headset down and let it go into standby, then pick the headset back up again the image is then fine and rendered correctly.

Does anyone have any ideas?

Thank You",1575728795.0,1,0,129422
Vive,"We released our new update ""Tesseract Abyss"" for Swords of Gargantua","Hi all,

We released new free DLC for Swords of Gargantua, called Tesseract Abyss!

It's a rogue-lite mode that can be done solo or through multiplayer. Players move downwards into the ""abyss"" fighting in different areas that are chosen from a random selection after each stage.

Along the way you'll earn power-ups, can collect weapons, craft them into stronger weapons and level up your own character's base abilities. There'll even be a shop that appears from time to time which you can buy items (like power-ups and health) through the coin you earn by winning battles.

If you die, you'll carry everything over into the next play minus your initial level. It's pretty tricky so you'll most likely die a few times. Looking forward to seeing everyone progress through it!

Please check it out and let me know what you think!

I saw a suggestion someplace saying that the bluetooth something or another might have died inside the controller, but I'm hoping that's not the case, cause one of these controllers is $120 and christmas just blew through my wallet.

I have VR myself at home, a Vive as well, and the games run through Steam VR and a few other internal systems, so I’m really hoping it has something to do with the ‘public’ software.

The games based in Unreal Engine 4, and was never designed to use a Tracker, but we do anyways. It was tacked on right before it shipped, probably because it’s a buggy mess.. One of the PCs has been coming up with ‘Fatal Error’ when trying to start the experience.

And it doesn’t happen consistently either, about 80% of the time it’ll crash, then it’ll work for no apparent reason. What’s going on?

Vive,OG Vive Motion Blur and Warping,"I have the OG Vive and this problem started suddenly about a year ago. I first noticed it in SteamVR home with the text that shows your games and other rooms you can join. If I move my head, the text will warp and trail. It is worse as I turn my head and look through the periphery of each lens. Happens equally on both sides. Once I keep my head still, it mostly goes away. Most all games are still playable, but if I stand still in a game environment and move my head around, I can see the environment warping a little bit as well. Issues I've ruled out are any headset adjustments (IPD, lens distance) and headset positioning on my face. I turned off motion smoothing and toggled a few software settings without success.

System specs are: 

OG Vive w/ original lighthouses

GTX 970 x 2 in SLI (Old I know. Tried to fix the problem by separating SLI and switching from one graphics card to the next, neither of which fixed it, so I put them back into SLI).

i7 4790K 4ghz

16gb DDR3 ram

Any ideas as to why this might be happening and is there anything else I can try? I'm hoping my lenses haven't become damaged over time, but the problem is equal in both eyes, so I suspect a software, graphics card, or headset problem. Things are still playable, but seeing the trailing and warping is very bothersome.",1575660623.0,1,2,129422
Vive,"So, what actually is the upgraded/second gen. of Vive? The Cosmos? The Pro?","So I've just been getting really interested in getting a VR headset. It's always interested me, but now I'm am feeling really close to pulling the trigger. But, when looking through the deals on Black Friday and Cyber Monday, I almost came out of it more confused. It really seems like the Rift S could be okay because I like the controllers, but the lower refresh rate, and the fact that Oculus is Zucc tech, pushed me away from it pretty quickly. The Index is still a little too high for my liking (not saying it's not worth it, just that I don't feel like splurging). WMD's are better than you expect but still have tracking issues. So, I usually end the thought process that Vive is the way to go.

But I don't really know what to get. Spec-wise, the OG Vive seems a little old for me regarding resolution specifically, but as a whole I still don't feel like it's enough. I don't know where the road goes after that, though. The Vive Pro looks pretty good spec-wise, but without having any controllers or lighthouses right now, I'd be better off getting an Index. The Cosmos looked like it might've been what I was actually wanting, but I've only heard bad things of it. In the end, I almost am where I start in the beginning because nothing feels right for me to buy. Is there anything down the pipeline that might be popping up, like more upgrades or updates?

Vive,HMD weighs more on one side? (Original Vive),"I just got a (Used) Vive today after using an Oculus for the last 1.5 years, and have been playing around for a little bit, and I have noticed the right side weighs down on my head considerably more than the left, and sits crooked on my face most of the time. I'm always grabbing the headset and readjusting it because my right eye is always off center except for the few seconds I readjust before it falls away again.

&amp;#x200B;

I've tried pulling the cables out just a bit from the headset to loosen the slack, and that did not help, and i have the vive delux strap on. I've tried looser and tighter, adjusting my ipd even to see, but nothing alleviates it.

&amp;#x200B;

It's really quite frustrating, Did I do something wrong with the strap or something?

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: Re put on the strap and am wearing the hmd much tighter and it seems to fit on nicely. It's not on painfully tight or anything, just much more than I'm used to with the oculus. So far so good now!

I am wondering.. if you top these up and then put them in a drawer for a few months, will they be drained dry?

The problem: if i plug it in/power the linkbox i get 2 sound notifications, Multimedia and VIVE Cosmos. the multimedia audio disappears after about 5 seconds, but the Vive Cosmos is still to be found under Windows settngs-&gt; Devices.

I try to connect to Viveport, and i try to connect to SteamVR, but have had no success. SteamVR has never displayed anything but ""please plug in your VR headset"" 

&amp;#x200B;

Trying different USB ports, power cycling, refreshing USB connections in steamvr, enable direct display mode, and finally Reinstalling my OS has done nothing, reinstalling steamVR, steam and viveport quite a few times, no change..

The best game I've played so far was Arizona Sunshine, and that game would barely even be noticed in the traditional gaming space. I've refunded half a dozen games already because they were just pure garbage.

Oh and then there's a few multiplayer shooter games. Competitive games are a young man's crowd.

I am so excited about this VR headset and yet I don't feel like there's much left to do with it. 

Beat Saber is fun, but I've never been big on rhythm games.

Blade &amp; Sorcery is insanely fun for a few hours, but even with all the mod support it's still basically the same thing over and over. Also I am not looking forward to explaining myself to my wife if she ever sees what I'm doing in that game.

Gorn is the same thing but now everything is made out of dildos or something. Pass.

Sariento I got super into for a few hours, but it's hella jank and gets old pretty quick too.

Vive,audio distortion/weirdness on Vive Pro - USB C to 3.5mm workaround?,"hey folks, i know this has been talked about a lot, but not recently - furthermore all the threads i searched are archived so i can't bump a topic, so i'm forced to retread old ground, of sorts.

anyway i'm a teacher at a university and we purchased a Vive Pro headset which worked fine with a older desktop. then we switched to a laptop - Alienware 17"" - and now from the Vive Pro's HMD audio  i'm getting very strange digital artifacts - buzzing, chirps, etc, especially when playing audio that stops and starts. the laptop's speaker and headphone audio are totally fine. so, i did a lot of diving into reddit threads to find that there are a lot of variations on this issue, and it seems to be related to the 'Vive Pro Mutimedia device driver' (yes it's accurately misspelled) which seems to be a USB Audio device going out to the Link box. i did testing outside of VR just in a browser opening up Youtube and setting the laptop to use the Vive as the audio output, and the audio had the same glitchy behavior, so it's not just in VR that the issue happens, at least for me.

fixes i've tried:according to one account, the NVIDIA HD Audio drivers were possibly interfering. so i removed them, and just used the 'Mutimedia driver'. no change in behavior. then i reinstalled the HD Audio drivers and disabled the non-HD driver. same effect - no change. i've unplugged the link box and restarted it, and it doesn't seem to do anything either. however running a long audio cable from the headphone jack on the laptop to a set of earbuds resulted in clear, glitch-free audio, though now with two cables to deal with instead of one. one thought i did have concerning the new SteamVR audio oriented update (1.8) that just dropped, is i wonder if it actually was a step backward and is causing these issues. would love to rollback to an earlier driver to test but search results covering how to downgrade SteamVR are depressingly sparse to non-existent.

so continuing from the workaround perspective, i'm aware that you can purchase a USB C to audio adapter hooked up to the port on the HMD, but curious what's a good one? would i need one with a right angle USB connector so as to be unobtrusive? if someone could help me with some product links i'd be grateful! likewise anyone with similar issues just to get confirmation or fixes would also be appreciated. thanks in advance!",1575525219.0,1,4,129422

Vive,Crazy behavior of one of two base stations 2.0,"Hey guys, I got the Vive Pro Full Kit yesterday and everything works fine so far. However on the Power Management Tab I discovered, that one base stations has a connection failure, it works absolutely fine while playing tho. I make it short:

\- Everything is freshly updated and on the newest version

\- Power Management: One BS is working fine the other has a warning sign: ""Connection failure, click refresh to try again"", when I turn off VR, the working BS is going into sleep mode (intended) while the other obviously not.

\- Channel Configuration: The BS is discovered and working, but I cant switch channels. When I click on it it says: ""BS requires a device update to enable channel configuration.

\- In the Device Manager (Windows 10) everything looks good.

\- The other base station is working absolutetly fine altho I updated both successfully.

\- Both work fine while gaming

Vive,The Cosmos is the right idea sold the wrong way,"I've had a chance to try out the Cosmos and quickly noticed it could have filled a niche in the market, but doesn't. It's strength is versatility, as it can do pretty much anything - inside out, base stations, wireless, etc. 

I think one reason it is failing is the lack of versatility in purchasing options. They should sell the headset cheaply with no faceplate or features, and let people purchase their favorite accessories seperately. Not many people will be happy purchasing it as is, bundled with junk at a premium price. For example, right now if you wanted to use base stations, you're still stuck paying for the cost of an unused inside out faceplate which is a large extra expense. 

The wands are absolute garbage and I think many people would be happy if they could combine index knuckles while using the Cosmos headset. Again you're forced to purchase spendy HTC accessories that are best left unused. With inside out, the tracking is at best marginal. However a huge mistake was needing a total of four AA batteries to run these things for just a few hours.  USB recharging is the only solution that makes sense, and adding more disposable batteries to an already crappy design is just a big step backwards. It's possible the inside out tracking can be further improved through firmware updates, and current users should consider themselves volunteer beta testers while they try.

All that aside, the Cosmos has some great video and audio qualities and is one of the more versatile headsets as far as possible options that can be added. The flip up option is pretty neat. Because it already comes bundled with all of the low end gear, anyone wanting to add stations or wireless is going to be out a ton of money, which makes a high end set a better option instead.",1575357826.0,121,54,129422

Vive,Is using a DVI/D to VGA to the monitor downgrade the VR experience ?,"Hello guys !

Just for some context (if you like to read my bad english, if not, TL;DR at the bottom), a friend of mine recently bought the HTC Vive, and because she didn't know how to set it up, i helped her throught pains and frustrations on mic.

The thing is, i sold her my old GTX 970 MSI (for cheap don't worry) to replace her old graphics card that wouln't have run anything anymore.

But when she had to plug things, i've felt dumb to not thinking about it; the HDMI cable was already taken.

For more context, the 970 has : 1 HDMI / 1 Display Port / 1 DVI-I / 1 DVI-D

Welp i quickly told her to buy an adaptator because her monitor has only a HDMI or VGA input.

So she went out to buy a VGA/DVI adaptator and everything went fine, until she started to play it and said it was ""quite pixely"". Note; i can't try this by myself as we are living 5 hours away, and my perception would have been corrupted by the Index.

By reading a tutorial [here on steampowered.com](https://support.steampowered.com/steamvr/HTC_Vive/) i've seen; *""If you don't have any HDMI output available, you can use a DisplayPort to Mini DisplayPort.""*

**So my question is:** Is using a DVI/VGA adaptator to the monitor change/downgrade the quality of the Vive ? I hope my english is understandable.

**TL;DR:** Friend new to VR, not enough ports at the back of the graphics card, switch the HDMI to the monitor to the VIVE and using a DVI/VGA adaptator to the monitor.
Friend complained about the pixely thing. Question is; does the adaptator change/downgrade the quality of the Vive ?

Vive,HTC Vive Pro- (Review and comparison with modded lenses),"\----TL:DR- Can skip to my 2 ¢ below----

I have had the original Vive for about 3 years or so and I wanted a higher resolution headset. I have not had a reason to upgrade HMD's and was holding off. With the recent announcement of Half Life: Alyx, Metal of Honor VR, and then Boneworks coming out in a few days I had the itch to burn some more money on this niche market. Well, Vive Pro was $200 off last week and was almost the same amount as the Index, headset only. The 120-144hz refresh rate of the Index and it still being $100 cheaper than the Vive Pro's (sale price) seemed like the way to go. But I wanted to retain my Vive Wireless attachment and Index does not have a solution for this yeeeet! So I got the Pro, watch the Index get some new tech right after this review and releases wireless capabilities...

I have modded the lenses, upgraded my pc more than enough (pretty much built a new one will show some specs below), added a Vive wireless attachment, wireless ModMic, deluxe audio strap, made some custom foam inserts/pads for added comfort or support, Index controllers, special straps for my Vive wands I made, and a few other odds and ends in order to make VR more enjoyable. I find many little things that annoy me and I have to tweak them. I don't play all the time but I still have logged around 600 hours or more in VR with more than 94 game titles. I play anything from Onward (161 hours played) to Beat Saber and Skyrim VR (with plenty of mods in both) so I would say I am a pretty big enthusiast and I love VR, I don't play many 2d games anymore after I got into it.

OG Vive has to have most of these mods in order for me to play them. Overall the one mod I have to have is the lenses, I can't STAND the Vive and Vive Pro's garbage fresnel lenses at all. I have a few friends who have the same opinion but get a lot of mixed reviews online about the lens swap. After a few friends purchased a Vive, after playing mine a few times, they then asked why mine looks so much better than theirs... the solution to this blurry god ringed ""high quality"" HMD is--- $30 Samsung Gear VR Lens Swap! + adapters. They went proceeded to get new lenses ASAP after I told them.

# ---- 2 ¢: REVIEW/COMPARISON w/ mod----

So I couldn't find anything besides reviews or comparisons on the stock headsets with the OG Vive and Vive Pro so I decided I would make an ass of myself reviewing these with mods. Well many people love the Samsung Gear VR mod yet many do not. I am not sure where people get the idea that the Samsung lenses cause some issue's and they revert back to the fresnel lenses saying they distort the view or they make everything look flat. I have heard this a few times, but have also seen Reddit posts that the reviewer said they absolutely hated the lens mod, just to see an update later saying they installed the lenses backward lulz.

I can say for sure, comparing the the Vive and Vive Pro was not seeming to be worth the money right out of the box the other day. God rays annoy me, the sweet spot is tiny on the OG and Vive Pro lens. The comfort of the Vive Pro is amazing and I can see me enjoying being in VR much longer... yet something seemed wrong about this upgraded HMD. I just dropped $600 on a headset and the resolution did not seem really any better. I couldn't read writing in the Steam Menu, distant Tree's in Skyrim VR were just as blurry as the OG Vive, and I really couldn't justify the headsets price. I was very disappointed besides the better weight distribution making the headset have a much greater wearability vs the Old Vive with a deluxe audio strap.

Swapping out the lenses I couldn't help but feel like I was going to be returning this new HMD as it wasn't worth the money first go, and instead maybe I could give my mother the money to get a new set of teeth. Thank god I was wrong she can continue to starve! NIGHT AND DAY difference in clarity, the sweet spot is improved, and god rings vanish into my terrible memory where I file repressed fragments of my past. But I have already seen this before with the OG Vive w/mod. The thing I really wanted was crisper distant objects, as this was the last thing I needed for a greater immersion. I could make out far off distant objects right away. In Skyrim, Onward, Fallout, and even modded games that are not meant for VR originally... you name it I can see it. Instead of a blob of a tree 100-200 or so yards out, I could see a tree with crisp lines and it not forming into the background like a terrible painting with the colors bleeding together.  *With the stock lenses on the Pro OR on the OG Vive w/ the mod*, this was always the case, distant backgrounds form together, as if you needed glasses and were nearsighted. Up close everything looked great, far away not soo much. But the Vive Pro lets me see a farther distance hands down with the new optics. I would seriously play a OG Vive with the lens mod over the Pro with stock lenses.

I obviously have a bias towards this mod over the stock garbage that who ever came up with should be euthanized, but I also understand these lenses really help people with motion sickness.

&amp;#x200B;

**Image-** Some say you lose 3d image with this mod, maybe it is a little more flat: *8.5/10 from the stock lens 7/10  w/mod*

**Sweet Spot-** Same as the OG Vive w/mod, but you get better FOV. The 15-20% sweet spot upgrades to like 70% w/ mod: *10/10, for both OG and Pro.*

**Clarity-** Distant objects, up close, writing/text all much easier to see now Hands down a *10/10* w/mod  from a *5/10 before*! Likewise with the OG Vive w/mod, but the Pro really has a lot more details at a distance than the OG Vive w/mod. This was what I wanted as I felt immersion in a game like Skyrim is thrown off by a bleeding together background.

**Field of View-** On the OG Vive w/mod you did lose a bit of FOV (5-8%) , but not with the Vive Pro thanks to the telescoping screen! With glasses, you will lose FOV and how much depends on how far they stick out, but I press these babies right up to by corneas so my I can have my ""retinas seared like tuna steaks"": 8\*/10\* as you get a little more binocular feel but not much as you may notice on the OG vive and that the Vives just don't have the best FOV anyway.

**Screen Door-** I did notice a tiny amount but even with the stock HMD, it is much less with the new rez of the Pro! Maybe a little more noticeable with the new lenses popped in but nothing you will see without really trying to notice it. Much better than the OG Vive! Especially in low light/high contrast locations: *8/10*

**God Rays-** The awful god rays are gone, but still get a little bit of haze/fog off of low light/high contrast area's (like if you are in a dungeon or crypt in Skyrim and the candles cause a awful god ray, you get a little haze, still 100x's better than being blinded by the fresnel lenses).

**Performance-** This does not really pertain to the mod, but overall some games don't like the wireless with the higher resolution. Most dev's have done a great job and they work fine. In less optimized games you might have to kick the setting back a little as I did with games like Cosmic Sugar. Which is almost unplayable for the Vive pro? =(

**Barrel Distortion-** There is some small distortion on the edges of the new lens like the old Vives mod, but it is easily changed with swapping some lines of code out. I did not test it without the new lines of code and I am using the 2nd set of upgraded ""code"". I think they have the 3rd set out now. Either way you have to look at the edge of your lens to see this and is not noticeable unless you are picky as all hell, in that case grow up children (as I sit here and complain about all the little things I hated on my OG Vive)..... hypocrisy at its finest!

Thanks for reading! Hope my incoherent rambling, poor grammar and nonsense was somewhat helpful.

*ME*\--*""I felt like I was wasting money after getting the Wireless attachment and not seeing much for new content coming out in the land of VR, after Half Life was announced I realized that the market was soon to explode and VR would consume my life.... well hopefully after wasting another $600+ on this crap""*

Vive,GearVR lens mod - distortion tips?,"Good day,

I was able to get my hands on a 2016 GearVR for $20 and a buddy printed me the lens adapters, so I went ahead and did the lens mod.

Amazingly clear. Fantastic.

Naturally there is some distortion and I applied a bunch of the various fixes. Some worked better than others, and now I am trying to dial it in with  SteamVR-Undistort, starting with the V3 profile. 

Having some success, but I'm wondering if anyone has tips on using it more efficiently? 

As well, I've read that I should do it with the green crosshairs, but is this the crosshair with all the hash marks, or the simple crosshair that's just two intersecting lines?

Cheers.

Update:  got it all dialed in, almost completely perfect! Used V4 of the distortion fix and did a bit of additional tweaking in the Undistort tool, pretty much just around the edges. For $20 this had a major impact on my experience, I love it.

I also see why some people can't stand it, before I got it dialed in (took hours and tried every version of the fix I could find) this made me fairly dizzy and looked really distorted. It seems you need the patience and time to really fiddle with it for this to work well for some people, although my wife threw it on (before it was dialed in) and couldn't see any distortion at all.",1575321744.0,5,24,129422

Vive,VIVE official certified pre-owned nightmare.,"I've been really wanting to get VR for years now, and just this black friday weekend the vive store was selling them for $350 certified pre-owned, free shipping and everything. Great! So I ordered it, it shows up today, and I can't wait to get things set up. Once everything is set up, all I gotta do is plug in the Linkbox and the headset. So, I go to plug in USB, HDMI, and then.. the power cable was the wrong size. I go and check and my heart sinks. I got three identical power cables and they only fit the base stations. I guess the third one was supposed to be the power adapter that would've fit the Linkbox to power the headset, however, that cable is too large to plug into the Linkbox. It only fits the base stations.

Has anyone else received the wrong power adapter? HTC wasn't much help with support. They offered to have me pay to ship it back, wait a few weeks, and eventually get an answer. Or, wait a few more weeks to get the right power adapter sent to me as they were apparently short on supply.",1575330632.0,4,11,129422

I told him (by text) buy a couple Rift S's today on Cyber Monday for $700 total and go to Best buy and tell them you want a minimum of i7 7700k, GTX 1060, 8gb RAM

Also: he wants to play online games with me since he never gets to see me so I thought we could play VRChat and Pavlov

Can this* PC run both smoothly? (I sent him the link)

I spent a good 6ish hours getting project cars working decently enough, and it's pretty awesome. The rendered interiors are amazing, and the hud is pretty cool too.

Either I'm way ahead of everyone, or I get behind and it feels like there is no possible way to catch up.

Yesterday my headset crashed (black screen in headset, no longer being picked up by base stations) and SteamVR said I needed a firmware update for my headset.

Firmware update fails. Says I need to plug in my headset to the computer or try unplugging headset and plugging it back in.

Best I can tell from Steam VR Troubleshooting, and Vive and Viveport troubleshooting, you shouldn't need to plug in a wireless adapter headset to update the firmware.

I've rebooted the USB and reinstalled them, with no luck. 

My SteamVR is currently in a loop of knowing it needs to update drivers and the updates failing. 

I don't have the Pro, but I do have the wireless adapter, so I think I'm in this odd middle ground in terms of places to go for troubleshooting.

Vive,Minimizing VR UI Friction in Fast-Paced Combat,"After dealing with the UI system in Skyrim VR which pulled you out of combat every time you wanted to change attacks, I wanted to create a UI system which effectively allows for real-time combat in non-shooter games.

[My solution](https://i.imgur.com/83GKOGT.mp4) is to have four anchor-points around the screen which, when grabbed, each activate a unique spell. Similarly, different variations of any skill can be toggled by grabbing and quickly releasing any anchor point which effectively allows for real-time access to up-to eight spells. With the Index's large FOV, enough room is left that the viewing experience still feels uncluttered.

There is also an added benefit that four stationary points around the edges of your screen gives you a constant point of focus which can somewhat reduce motion sickness in some people.

Vive,How do I make Vivecraft Seated Mode feel more realistic?,"Hello, I am thinking about playing Vivecraft and I don't have alot of money, so I saw a guide that allows you to play Vivecraft with google cardboard. There is one issue, though, you can only play Vivecraft with google cardboard in Seated mode and not standing up mode. 

That kind of sucked because I don't like how the HUD is straight up over your arm and the mouse is just weird and you can't really use your headset to determine where you are looking and Standing Up mode just feels and looks better, but because of my super low budget, I might not be able to achieve that.

I did some research and found some driver application that allows people to use Wii Remotes as controllers, so maybe I could use standing up mode like that with Wii Motion Plus controllers but the application software costs quite alot, most people do not recommend using Wii Remotes as controllers and the free trial of it kind of sucks.

So I was wondering, is it possible to maybe change how Vivecraft works in Seated Mode so that whenever I move my head, the crosshair moves with the tracking of my head so that I don't have to move my mouse around to aim at where I want to break blocks? I mean, it seems kind of useless to be able to move your head around full 360 degrees, but not be able to aim where your cursor crosshair is.

I was also wondering if I could use Seated Mode whilst standing up so that I could feel more immersed by moving my head and body around whilst using some sort of joytokey software to bind controls to a controller for fun.

(I had an htc vive for 3 years and have had the index since it came out to major market). And i really think I'm missing a game that I would think is super fun. I really like plane games, because planes are just cool. And generally they are combat ones like war thunder. But I want one that has an airplane, maybe 2 seater with a pilot and a gunner in the back like early ww2 american planes. Or maybe a full bomber with like 7 people in it, but ita not just where you are controlling everything like war thunder. It should be like star trek bridge crew, where one person controls everything. And maybe if theres not enough people switching positions.you have to fight off enemy aircraft, get bombs ready to drop, drop them and fly back safely. ( game would probably last like 20 or 30 mins like the submarine game, which is good but not exacly what I am looking for). And I dont want to stop at just aircraft. So for tanks they can have a driver, gunner/loader(being a loader would be boring unless its shared with the commander, maybe there is a loader which is a commander ane has a machine gun to use for AA or for ground troops.) And a machine gunner up front too like a sherman or something. A tank game like this would be absoloutly amazing.

Vive,I’m in the market for a VR headset since Black Friday is going on. Is buying a VIVE used worth it?,"I was pretty set on buying a VIVE until I realized they aren’t restocking them. I see a lot of people on here selling their old VIVEs. I’d prefer to have original packaging in order to help my dumbass set the damn thing up, but other than that I’m fine with buying used.

Would it be more worth it to get a new Rift S instead? I’ve always thought of the Rift S as inferior to the VIVE, but I’m not quite sure how inferior it is. I’m also not interested in the Quest since it plays like shit in VRchat. I’d like my money to be worth it. Any help would be appreciated, thanks!",1575065807.0,3,14,129422
Vive,HTC VIVE Bluetooth questions...,"Hey, so I've had my Vive for a year now, and since I got myself a newer phone (Xiaomi MI5) {I had a rusty iPhone 5s xD} and decided that I could pair it with the headset so that I could know if someone's calling, texting me etc, but the damned thing keeps disconnecting after:

1: Turning on Steam Home

2: Turning on any game or app

3: Switching games/apps

Vive,PSA: The $5 Steam Controller can be harvested for parts to repair your Vive wands!,"I think this is fairly common knowledge, but as per subject the track pads in the Steam Controller are a 100% swap-out replacement for the track pads in the Vive wands.  As many of us have found out the hard way, those track pads will break the plastic housing and pop out (ripping the ribbon cable) with a solid crack against the wall at the wrong angle.

The only difference I've noticed in performing this operation several (4?) times now is that a) the Steam controller has only one fully smooth pad and b) the ribbon cable on the Steam controller is slightly longer than the native Vive wand cable, but still fits perfectly as a replacement.  Otherwise, the connector head, form factor, mount points and responsiveness are identical.  No glue, no nonsense.  Just swap the part and you're back in the game!

If your kids have VR Gorn parties, you will want a few of these ;)

I would always recommend pursuing warranty repairs if that is an option, but for most Vive owners, that is no longer the case.  You will of course need to watch a vid or two on carefully opening up your controllers and wands, but the operation is pretty straightforward, and doable with minimal experience if you have the right screwdriver.

With 4 boys and 2 VR rooms at my house, this has saved us a ton of money on repairs.  Highly recommended.  At $5 on sale right now, I suggest any Vive owner stock up and keep them in a closet as cheap spare parts!

Remember that each controller also comes with that magical Steam USB stick, so if you're upgrading to Index, you can use those dongles to pair your old wands as strap-on foot trackers...",1574902586.0,429,43,129422

Vive,How big of a difference will overclocking further make?,"Hey guys, I'm posting this here specifically rather than an overclocking forum because in VR we have other considerations, and a few FPS may well make a difference. I have an 8700K processor that is running at 4.8Ghz, but runs pretty hot at the moment at load, like high 80s, or low 90s, sometimes worse. I'm using the wireless adapter, and using FPS VR you can see that it does cap out my processor, not infrequently. 

So, the question for anyone who has tried is would it be worth delidding the processor, and maybe upgrading the cooler also? De-lidding would cost around $50 all told, and it looks like an upgraded cooler is more like $100. I definitely *could* spend that money, but it's not insignificant by any means. I'm guessing that doing both of these things would allow me to get up to around 5.2Ghz at slightly cooler temps than I'm at right now, as the cooler alone appears to give a 10-15c difference at load, and delidding is more like 15-20c, so that would be pretty significant together. 

How big of a difference would a 400Mhz be in terms of VR performance with the wireless adapter? If it's 1FPS, that's definitely not worth it to me. If it's 5-10FPS, it may well be.",1574981009.0,1,4,129422

Vive,My computer keeps crashing while playing VR,"So I got an RX 580 4GB refurbished graphics card from newegg back in July, and got a used Vive off craigslist in September. They've both been working perfectly for months with little to no problems arising. However, a few days ago when I was trying to play beat saber, SteamVR kept crashing and so would Steam itself. After 3 or 4 tries, I restarted my computer and tried again. It still was acting a bit weird and took a long time to load, but eventually I got it to start up. Then last night I bought some new games, the seemingly problem one being sprint vector. I had my friends try it out and when they were selecting the character it kept getting errors saying ""out of memory"", which is weird because I have 16GB of ram in my computer. After it crashed twice we went back to beat saber. After about 20 minutes of playing, it randomly crashed my whole computer. We turned it back on and now every time I try to play it, it lasts about 3 minutes before crashing. My question is, what is the problem? My first guess would be the graphics card since it was refurbished, but the low memory error I keep getting makes me think it might be the ram. Below I have the specs to my computer. (I'm kinda hoping it's the graphics card so I can upgrade to an RTX)

A lot of times when I want to quickly access my desktop from within VR I'm greeted by a full-screen game window with no way to close or minimize.

Vive,Index controllers + Pavlov VR = wow,"I just received my Index controllers.  Figured I was going to get them with Alyx, so I might as well get them now.  

So far I've only used them with the lab program as well as Pavlov VR since Pavlov is the main game that I play these days (close to 700 hours logged in it).  

It took about 30 minutes to get comfortable with the new mechanics, but once I did, holy crap.  Pavlov is really a very different game with the new controllers, and I'm guessing the same is probably true for other games as well.  

It's much better.  Way more immersive.  The main mechanic I had to learn was holding the gun.  The default position is an open hand as in normal life.  But if you do that in the game, you drop the gun (unlike with the wands where you hold onto the gun until you release them with a button click).  In order to hold onto the gun, you have to close your grip around the controller as you would close your grip around the grip of the gun.  Makes sense.  But the really cool thing is when you grip with the other hand as well.  You just grip your other controller as you would in real life.  No buttons.  It took some getting used to, but after I did, I found it much better, faster, and more intuitive.  

And then there's picking things up.  Medicine bottles, grenades.  Holstering, putting primary guns on your back.  Pavlov is a super great game, don't get me wrong, but there is quite a bit of room for improvement for interactivity.  Things are a little glitchy, but the new mechanics really got me thinking 'Man, this is incredibly realistic, more immersive, and in a way that really improves gameplay.'.  

I found that even within 30 minutes of getting used to the new controls, that I kinda had an advantage over the players who didn't have the Index controllers.  I noticed that the controllers were less in the way, and that I was more 'in the game'.  I could fire the pistols more easily and accurately, even the Barret.  But as I said, it improves the game play and the ability of the player to perform  in the game in the right way.  

Then there's flipping people off.  I'll be like 'hey, come here'  to a teammate.  I come over to him real close and then slowly and gingerly reveal my middle finger.  Its' really awesome.

Vive,Question regarding the Lighthouse Placement (Gen1),"Hey guys,

I just have a quick question regarding the placement of the lighthouses of the HTC VIVE, so the old ones, not the new ones.

I have this room ([https://imgur.com/a/SJuWX8T](https://imgur.com/a/SJuWX8T)) and want to place them bove on the wall where the dart board is placed. One in each corner. The wall is 4,10 meters wide, so they are probably about 1,90 to 2 meters apart when I put them up. Also the wall has a height of 2,60 meters and I am planning to put them up at around 2,40 meters. The direction I would mainly look while playing would be away from the wall, so facing towards the location of the picture taken.

Would this placement be possible with using the sync cable connected to both lighthouses?

Vive,Are there any good articles about the performance improvements from the HTC Vive Pro Eye?,"Its been a while since I've read anything about Foveated Rendering.   Im using a Rift so I dont always keep up with the news from the Vive side of things.  But the Vive Pro Eye was release earlier this year right?  Are there any good articles  with real world testing, about how much the foveated rendering actually reduces GPU workload?  I have seen things where Oculus stated in some of their testing, the foveated rendering allowed for a 20x savings in what needed to be rendered.  Im just curious what this looks like in the real world currently.      I want to know what peoples opinions are, that have used it.  Ive got a 980ti and a 6700k right now.  Id love to hear that with foveated rendering, that those specs would become more than enough for future High end headsets since it only renders such a small area at full resolution.

&amp;#x200B;

I know foveated rendering is still very new and still being worked on, and everything is subject to change.  Im just wanting some good stuff to read, thats not just from keynotes or development articles,  to keep me hyped for when it does go mainstream.   I just want to see how the current version has been working for people with real world examples.   Ive tried finding some stuff to read or watch, but all i can find just seems to be stuff from early this year, before the headset was launched.

When I kill some of these, they instantly come back sometimes opening something related to SteamVR, such as ""Pair a controller.""

I will say I am happy with my purchase, it takes a brain rework to ""let go"" of them after years of holding the wands constantly. It has to be said, the tracking is amazing.

Vive,Is the HTC Vive still worth it now? (Looking forwards to Half Life: Alyx),"Hey,

I was considering buying the standard HTC Vive (£500) for Half Life: Alyx. I obviously will play other VR games too.

My Dad hates the idea of buying a VR headset that has already been out for 3-4 years and is utilsing ""older tech."" Although I see his point, I don't agree with him saying I should instead buy the ""newer tech"" such as the Steam Index for basically double the price (£900).

Can you outline the advantages and disadvantages around this? I understand the Steam Index has better resolution, refresh rate, fov over the Vive - however that's obviously to be expected for a newer product. I can afford the Steam Index but it is still very expensive.

So, is the HTC Vive (The standard version for about £500) worth it as of 2019/2020?

Vive,New VR (oddly shaped) space...a bit stumped on solution,"I have an OG Vive and used it in my old home office/computer room which was a normal rectangle shape, so easy-peasy setup. A few months ago I moved and my new home office is a loft which is actually waaaay more spacious, except that the ceiling is a sharp slant downwards. One side of the room is a good 20ft tall, the other end is 4ft.

The vive trackers say a minimum height of 6.5ft above the ground is required, so I can't place a tracker at the 4ft side of the room...so my only option is to awkwardly place one in the middle of the ceiling slant and cut my play area in half.

I was really looking forward to the **Cosmos** because it seemed like a great upgrade to the Vive and with inside out tracking it would solve this issue. Unfortunately I've just not been impressed with the reviews or hardware, and unfortunately this room is pretty dark most of the day, which I hear doesn't work well for the Cosmos.

I've also heard the **Valve Index** base stations can track without a minimum height (even though they recommend 6ft - it can be used at any height, so my 4ft wall will be fine). That said, the $999 price tag on the index is just a bit steep...

I've been pretty amazed by what **Oculus** has done with the quest and quest link. Having a truly on-the-go VR headset and a PC one is something I thought was years away. That said, I'm worried about it being a visual downgrade even from the OG vive. If I am going to be spending $$ to buy something new, I'd like it to be an improved experience in some way. I'd love to hear if I'm wrong about though!

So, this is where I'm a bit stuck. I'm not sure what the best path forward is for VR right now in my space without spending a ton of money or downgrading the experience slightly. Unless the Vive trackers *will* work with one at &lt;6.5ft after all (if anyone has experience with such, please let me know!).

I 100% lurked on this community for the past two years but I will not forget everything I’ve learned. All the niche games I found out about, quality of life settings, tutorials, etc.. Thanks guys! Here’s to the future of VR!

Edit: For those of you who wanted me to give my 2 cents on the upgrade. I think that it is well worth it. One of my few complaints is that if you have a big head then the shroud that sits on your face may be a bit snug on your temples and give you a pressure headache but with precise tweaking of the knob on the back plus the strap on top you can get it feeling pretty damn comfortable.  For image quality I think that this is well worth the upgrade. You become so much more immersed in the games you are playing when you aren’t constantly distracted by the screen door effect. One last thing, setup was beautifully easy especially since I already had mounts for the base stations. The software also doesn’t make you plug in the base stations to update them which is really nice. If any of you have any tips on where I could started figuring out how to correctly tweak my settings to get the best image quality to performance ratio I would greatly appreciate it. When I first started playing around with the headset my global resolution was set to 136% (what it was set to for the Vice).

Vive,Anywhere I can try an Index in the UK?,"I've posted a couple of times on my city's subreddit, despite being a huge city (Bristol), nobody has ever responded.

I don't mind travelling a little ways to try it, plus I'll be travelling up north before and during Christmas (and back, afterwards) so I'm reasonably flexible about location.

But I've had an OG vive since release date, and while I love it, I don't use it much because it's not the most comfortable to wear and it's such a faff - I know I should get the deluxe audio strap as half my faff is with sorting headphones out, and that thing is still ridiculously expensive. With the Alyx announcement I am considering an upgrade to the Index but I just want to try it first to make sure.

I recall with the Vive they demo'd it in various places, shopping malls, and various video game shops, but the Index? I can't find a whiff of it!

So I have a weird issue now after a year of using my Vive (The exact same Issue was btw the reason i gave back my Oculus to get a vive) Also i had this Issue after 2 Months but it randomly dissappeared. So whenever i Want to play a VR Game i set up the Sensor boxes and plug in the Cable box thing and then plug in the Vive. But since 2 Weeks the LED only lights up in red. Now heres the deal: I checked the hdmi cable, used a different one, checked the Cables  and ports on the vive, checked the hdmi and usb ports on my computer and reinstalled Steam VR. Nothing helped. When I plug the vive in the light is giving me hope that i could use it, but nope. The Second i start steam VR it just changes to red telling me that i am a complete failure and dissappointment in life. Steam Vr then tells me that i am currently playing steam VR changes after 5 seconds to ""searching for your headset"" and then just goes ""steam VR couldnt detect any headset"" While this happens i hear the classic Windows ""device disconnected"" and ""device connected"" sounds multiple times... The onyl thing i could imagine is to check the USB cable. I am gonna order one now to check on later this day. But still i .. jsut feel like thats not the reason.

Does anybody know what else could be the reason and what else i could try?",1574733136.0,1,5,129422

It works pretty much exactly as you think it would; swinging your arms back and forth would make you move forwards in the direction you swing your arms. You can even go backwards if you do the movement behind your back.

It may look silly, but personally it's been the best control scheme I've used. It gives a bit of exercise, it's easier to control where you're going and how fast you're going (your max speed is dependent on your personal speed), and it's been super-fun to use in general. Seeing all these games stick with either dashing or just a single joystick for movement feels disappointing, as there are other, more innovative and fun ways of moving about.",1574676997.0,16,33,129422

I usually wear glasses, but my glasses fit inside the Vive pretty well. Regardless, I decided to wear my contacts to play to really get that VR feel. But that's not the main problem. When I put on my headset, the only place where the views aren't blurry is when I have to push my VR up. Otherwise, the headset tends to sink down and rest right under my cheekbones. I have pretty high cheekbones, so that might be one reason, but another issue is that when the headset slides down, it also almost pulls my cheeks down and my eyelid is stretched down too. I'm not sure how I can fix this or if this should be normal. My eyes feel dry and irritated in just \~10 minutes of gameplay.

Vive,Advice on lighthouse placement with 3 base stations (part deux),"*My original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/Vive/comments/dmsxlx/advice_on_the_placement_of_20_base_stations_in_a. Making a fresh post since I ended up buying a third lighthouse and most advice was on two base stations.*

I've been playing VR for a month with temporary placements at E, on the island between G and D (where the second chair is) and at C behind the couch. So far it's going good. Sometimes I'm losing track on my left controller (facing the TV) but that might be due to the how placement of my temporary locations of the lighthouses.


B and C are not that convenient to wire power to them due to the many windows on that wall. There is a power socket at the bottom between B and C but there is no drywall to the top unless I buy a really long extension cable for the 12V. There is a small pillar as part of the frame of the window but its not ideal.

Floor plan: [top-down view of floorplan](https://i.imgur.com/bUh5zUp.png)

**Thoughts and notes on individual positions**

D has a large lamp in that corner which would occlude several angles if I mount it in the deep corner. A potential alternative is on the same wall as D but on the corner between D and F, It could potentially have a larger viewing angle. Might still need to move the lamp though.

E seems like a solid choice that covers seating VR and the majority of movements for room-scale.

**My concrete ideas on placement with 3 lighthouses:**

- **E, A, D**: With ""A"" a couple of feet to the right to be more in the center of the room covering the back of the play area. E and D cover both from the front but might be redundant. Possible occlusion by spectators in front of A.
- **E, C, D**: A variation of the previous where I swap A and C. Having C in the corner above the window prevents reflections but also is guaranteed to no not have any occlusion issues. It would also allow me to mount E deeper in the corner above the desk making it a bit less visible and makes cable management easier.

Seems like 2 pixels right beside each other .
Left one is stuck on green, right one seems to be stuck on a dark purple like color, or dark red.

Anything i can maybe do about this? Or is my hmd slowly on it's way to it's grave?

Not quite sure if they are stuck or dead.

I noticed this thanks to my vrchat friends bright orange hair.

I can't see it on black, only when there is dome color going on on those pixels, how brighter the color is supposed to be, the more it can be seen.

Was hoping to maybe squeeze a bit more life out of this hmd while saving up for either a Vive Pro HMD or Valve Index HMD. (Buying the Valve Index Controllers for sure, soon.)",1574533091.0,1,2,129422

I have a few friends who now seem interested in VR and none of them are considering the Cosmos due to its horrific reviews and price or the Vive Pro due to expensive price. 

So it feels like the only true option in the market is the Oculus Riff S, Quest, or Index - and given the price of the Index, I would imagine most people would are going to purchase and  Oculus. 

I think HTC is leaving a lot of money on the table in the VR mid tier market. It’s the perfect starter build for people who eventually want to build up to a Valve Index and they could be cashing in on the excitement.

My main priority is to play some games like Beat saber/vr chat/some simulators but would be nice if I would be able to run something that will allow me to headpat anime girls/slime rancher/minecraft or maybe other more demanding games like nostos/fallout4 (if these will work on basic vive, not sure if googles make impact on preformance).

Vive,Temporary lighthouse mounting fixtures?,"Hi.

I've just moved in to a new flat (apartment) and it's substantially nicer than our old one where I could just about get away with having black wires running up the walls. My SO is (understandably) keen that we keep it looking pretty fancy, too, and all the walls are white. So basically I think this means I'm going to struggle to 'integrate' my Vive's lighthouses (mk.1) with this new place's decor.

As such, I'm trying to find a temporary method of having lighthouses in the living room space, but these also can't take up much floor space because there's, well, not much floor space to take up. **I've seen the tripod stands** that people use but those would take up so much floor space that my play space would be tiny, I think. 

My ideal solution would be something like a picture frame but with a tripod mount instead of a picture and subtle hooks on the walls to hang the frames on, but I wonder if there's another solution with repeatable 'zeroing' - maybe something with magnets? - so that I don't necessarily have to redo the SteamVR room setup every time I want to play.

Also, I know you're supposed to not have any reflective surfaces in your space but I'm just not going to take our art down every time I want to play something - is there a solution to that other than taking down the art every time I want to play something, or maybe some tricks with regards to positioning the lighthouses so that this matters less?

Vive,Left eye showing up in right lens,"Hi,
For a while now, I've been having trouble with my Vive. On more intensive games, such as Skyrim VR and VRChat (thanks to custom avatars), I've been getting times where my left eye's display will be shown in my right eye. I've tried all of the following in order to fix it:

-Replaced the cables between the link box and the HMD twice

-Replaced the HDMI cable between the link box and my GPU

-Directly connected my HMD to my computer without the link box

Has anyone else gotten this error? I've noticed that it only really happens on intensive games where reprojection is high. I'm going to try to fiddle with some settings and see if that fixes it, but in the event that that doesn't work, does anyone have any suggestions? It's gotten to the point where some games are unplayable due to me having to keep my right eye closed to avoid motion sickness/dizziness/disorientation.

Disconnecting and reconnecting the HDMI cable on the link box seems to fix it, but only for a short while.",1574391142.0,0,1,129422

This seems like a big deal to me and got me thinking about the handful of local asynchronous co-op titles in the VR world like [Late for Work](https://store.steampowered.com/app/623540/Late_For_Work/) and [Eye in the Sky](https://store.steampowered.com/app/566700/Eye_in_the_Sky/). Has anyone tried this feature out with these games or others like them? I wonder how well it works because I feel like this has the potential to be a big deal for VR and VR adoption. Similarly to how [VRChat](https://store.steampowered.com/app/438100/VRChat/) has gotten so many people interested in the tech by playing with people in VR and sharing in their experience, this seems like it might add that same value to those games that have chosen to focus on the local multiplayer party-style experiences.

And another question - I wear glasses, do have minus 3 vision it's called here, not sure of the measurement system in your country my dude. So is it possible to wear glasses and the vr helmet, or you can customise the lenses in the helmet so you'll have 100% vision. Hopefully it is so.

It is more severe when I look around. There is no improvement standing a foot from (either) sensor in the corner of the room. If the system isn't grey screening, then the perspective drifts.

Note that, although my initial setup reads as correctly aligned (the red cone almost parallel to the green cone in the attached) that is no longer the case, as it suddenly shifts. This is approximately 30 degrees off of true measurement. The sensors are also at the corners of the play space.

I've also tested each base station individually by placing it in A mode. The drifting is only present on the red one, but both have issues with grey screening.

Anyhow, I've always been an Intel guy, but I don't care about the wireless adapter. Just thinking about my budget and wanting to not go crazy with it.

Any recommendations for a new rig? I don't want to go over... say... $350? If I can help it. I'm thinking maybe $120 for a mobo, $150 for a CPU, $80 for RAM.

Vive,Could HL:Alyx be the first true Index controller specific showcase game?,"Unlike Oculus with the Touch controllers Valve didn't drop any full-sized launch titles that either required Index controllers or had real consequence in using Index controllers.

Imagine a point in the game where you you need to maintain a specific squeeze pressure, not too much, not too little. That would be less fun to pull off with analog grips/triggers on Oculus Touch controllers and no fun at all to pull off with the analog pad on a Vive Wand. Folks asked to play Aperture hand lab with Touch controllers so they did it - but it's not at all a equal experience.

&amp;#x200B;

If Valve doesn't create an AA+ game that makes owning an Index controller worth the cost in a truly demonstrable and ""game changing"" way that eclipses Touch - who will?

Vive,Vive Wireless Quick Tips,"Been using Wireless for about 600 hours now, here's some tips:

\- Be super careful when you rest your headset backwards you don't bend your power or Vive Pro AIO cable! For whatever reason they though it was a good idea to use long straight cables, which you can easily push against and potentially damage.

\- The USB Power cable get hot! The USB A-A cable provided is absolute garbage and broke within a week for me, but yourself a thick A-A cable and be aware if it gets too hot it can cause your headset to disconnect.  I personally recommend buying a right angle USB cable.

\- 3rd party batteries are generally pretty decent, most 10k Mah batteries tend to get unreliable once they hit 25% - Either get two 10k batteries or one 20k. I personally run one 20k Mah battery taped to my headset which lasts around 8-9 hours.

\- You need a good processor to run Wireless, it tanks CPU usage. Running Vive Pro on an 8 core 5Ghz idles VR around 34%! Ensure you're running either an overclocked quad core or 6 core processor to avoid issues.

\- Wireless does overheat, I'm in Australia and it get quite hot. I would just recommend either using AC, or cooling it with a mini fan when it gets hot. This doesn't apply as much to standard vive as it outputs less heat.",1574140859.0,6,1,129422

While Steam may have a lot more VR games overall, they're often MUCH smaller and have MUCH smaller budgets. Sure, I could just use ReVive, but it's not always a perfect match.

Vive,"Today is the last day to use GonzoVR, ever","After a little over a year on Steam, we're shutting down GonzoVR for good later today.

We had a blast talking to the people who checked it out, and I genuinely have friends that I met in GonzoVR that I'm closer to than my meatspace-friends.

It's certainly true that our user numbers were never very large, but in the end that wasn't the main issue. We always felt that the first priority was to create something that people really sustainably enjoyed, and once we had that we would then focus on getting more broadcasters and users. The big problem was that the kind of experience that everyone enjoyed the most: small broadcasts with 3-6 people, could never be economically valid for a broadcaster. We tried a few things to foster larger groups while still giving everyone a chance to talk, but there is only so much speaking time to be distributed. As soon as someone felt that they weren't contributing, they would leave.

We're making a new application now that builds off of what we've learned that people want, and the kinds of social groups that lead to the most enjoyable experiences.

Anyway, as a final note, I just want to say thank you to everyone who took the time to try GonzoVR out, and leave a review. People saying nice things about our work was what kept us going for as long as we did.",1574028486.0,79,12,129422

Vive,Got GTA 5 VR working without VorpX. Veryjos injection / grandtheftvr.com mod gameplay. Can it get finished?,"I am getting into the veryjos GTA 5 Open VR that came out in 2015 or so and I have to say just as an injection into the Vive headset is perfect. Comparing this with the VorpX injection, i'm blown away on this one just on it's out of the box nature to work well and not make me sick. It's unfortunate that it only gives you a set of guns, and a taster of the game (although the experience is still really good) because I want to play the whole game in VR. This mod is  geared towards usb racing wheel users, which is why I assume it was set up to be used with only one controller. What happened to this mod's progress? SOMEONE GET THIS GUY A JOB AT Rockstar. The story campaign would be playable (despite weird glitchy cut scene stuff) and also the game in general if both controllers were put to use. With one controller I have trouble aiming and continuing on a straight path. It feels weird compared to set ups like onward.  


Also, the [Grandtheftvr.com](https://Grandtheftvr.com) mod works without Vorpx using this Veryjos OpenVR alpha, my only gripe with that is that you can't shoot out of the car like in the veryjos version. Also my previous experience with this mod was using Vorpx, and it was severely sickening and low frames per second. Playing the [grandtheftvr.com](https://grandtheftvr.com) mod with the Veryjos injection is much much more playable, like native VR. I also like how the control scheme is set up, even if I have to use VoiceAttack to jump into and out of cars. I'm still working on my voice attack bindings, and i'm hoping to bind a lot of the switching character stuff, the thing about voice attack is figuring out how long each button needs to be pressed so it's been not working perfectly. That's my fault though, as i said.  


What's weird is that after launching the grandtheftvr mod with the numpad, I decided to hit L and launch the Veryjos mod, and to my surprise I had a gun in each hand and could shoot both of them. Only when I moved away I noticed that veryjos mod gun was dragging behind and pointing towards me instead of where the controller was pointing. It's totally unplayable like this just to mention.  


I was going to buy myself a usb racing wheel so that I could hopefully get that working with the grandtheftvr mod (with more mods). I know it works in the veryjos mod and i'll give that a go as well, but i'm looking to do the campaign. I think if shooting a gun out of your car was added to the grandtheftvr mod then it would be totally playable with voice attack no problem because it runs great and the VR view just gives you a weird perspective during cut scenes. and you can't see the map unless you system button out to desktop view. but yeah no gun in car and you can't shoot the folks during the boat highway chase, ect.   


Is it me or can you not shoot the gun out of the car in the grandtheftvr mod? Maybe since i'm not using vorpx i'm missing a function? idk. You decide. Let know in the comments below. It would be nice if someone could fix these two mods up into a working mod, possible?",1573973008.0,46,18,129422

I tried switching the only functioning bluetooth dongle with a nonworking one on its (the one vive gives) hub thing.

This is very weird and frustrating to me, because when i connected the dongles directly through usb without the hubs, it shows in the ""bluetooth and other devices"" that i have 3 connected ""Watchman dongle"" so clearly they work?

So then why do the trackers not connect to them no matter what i do and how much i pair, and only stay with the blue light on?

I was looking at picking up a VR headset and was originally going to get the OG Vive as I had tried it out previously and really enjoyed it.

Got the  first htc vive with no deluxe audio and with the vive ugly wands.

Sadly....valve dont want my money so i cant buy a index in canada...but is the vive comos worth it? got a lot of comments about the rift or the quest as a better choice.

Vive,"So, is Vive lip tracker going to be a thing?","I recently started using the Vive Pro Eye in Neos for eye-tracking and the hardware for it is amazingly accurate. It tracks the eyelid, eye, and pupil movements. I'd love to see something for the rest of the face. 

Today, I noticed in the software about section for the tracking something interesting. There is a mention of a lip camera version. I was thinking maybe we could see this as an addon in the near future.

These items are permanent,  and are used to power up your character in many ways. For example  between sessions you can combine weapons to create stronger versions.  You can also use coins to buy health power ups.

Your  level will reset after each play but items and weapons will carry over.  You can carry up to four items / weapons into battle. Below is a link  to the full press release and screenshots. Do let me know what you  think!

Vive,Dement Demo Now Available,"Hello everyone!

We are pleased to announce the demo for Dement is now available. 

[https://store.steampowered.com/app/1022990/Dement/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1022990/Dement/)

&amp;#x200B;

What is Dement?

Dement is an open world survival horror game that has been in development for three years, and is available in early access now. Currently, the game has four of eight chapters, with most of the open world available. Throughout the early access period, we intend to pepper in new areas, weapons, and side quests while we continue to toil on getting the last four chapters done- and of course, fix any and all reported bugs. Purchase now and you will get access to ALL Dement content in the future, and be able to participate in the early access period. Suggestions are welcome; some have been made and already implemented!

&amp;#x200B;

Who is Paracytik Entertainment?

Paracytik Entertainment consists of mainly two people; one coder/designer and one writer. We hope to one day grow into something bigger, and to bring rich, fulfilling experiences to players everywhere. We want to be a part of a better gaming industry- one that focuses on games as art, moving stories, and engaging gameplay.

&amp;#x200B;

What can I expect from the demo?

The demo skips the prologue, and is the first three quarters or so of the first chapter on a 45 minute timer. The main menu, tutorial, and loading screens do not count towards the 45 minutes. If you die, half of the time since your last save will be returned to you. The first melee and ranged weapon will be provided immediately to speed up initial play. Expect to spend at least an hour playing this demo! If you get to ""The End of the Road"", tweet us a screenshot @paracytik for a congratulatory shout out! Good luck ;)

I just ordered a cosmos online, however I wasn’t privy to all this backlash circulating online regarding controller tracking, lowlight sensitivity. 

To anyone who owns this product, how are you liking it? Is it plagued with problems as described by some tech reviewers on YouTube? Or is this just a common hallmark of inside out tracking? I’m curious if people using the riftS or quest have similar issues regarding the controller tracking. 

Kinda wondering if I made a mistake , on paper the device sounded amazing. Either way I have a 90day return period if it doesn’t meet my quality standards. 

I am upgrading from the Rift CV1, so I’m hoping to see a massive improvement *fingers crossed*

I am super excited at the prospect of getting rid of the Fresnel lenses as they are the main source of my complaints with VR as a whole. Note that I can't afford to just upgrade to a better system as of yet, so that's not really an option.

I am looking at all the details involved and everything seems easy enough, but I have a couple questions about the 3D printed adapter that will be needed.

1: Is this still the best option for Gear VR (2016) to OG Vive adapter? :  [https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2837804](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2837804) 

2: If it is, which version would I be better off trying out, the fixed v3.3 or the adjustable v2.2 one?

Notes for 2: I do always use glasses with vive (as does my wife), but I don't know if it is necessary or even advised to go with the adjustable version. From the description, it appears that the maker still prefers the fixed version. I already feel like there's little to no room in the headset with my glasses and am hesitant to add anything extra in there.

3: Does the adjustable version need to be changed for each user, or is that a flat fix for the lens itself?

&amp;#x200B;

If anyone who has modded theirs and uses glasses can chime in, I would really appreciate a first hand accounting in regards to how the mod plays with glasses. Bonus points for anyone who shares the system with others with/without glasses to figure out how much of a pain changing settings are between users.

For those of you that own the regular Vive Pro or the Pro Eye version of the headset, I would like your opinions on a few things. Reviews aside, I'd really like to hear from typical users.

In your opinion, are the Pro Headsets worth an upgrade from the OG HTC Vive headset? (I'll either sell it to a friend or keep it for multiple users)

How's the audio quality of the speakers that come with the Vive Pro headsets? (I have the deluxe audio strap for my current Vive and the audio is pretty good on those) 

If you also use the Vive wireless adapter, were there any increase in latency or drops in performance?

Would 4 vive cosmos's work in this space? The issue then is I was planning to have a gun with vive tracker so then I am back to the original issue of tracking that, unless the cosmos can track vive trackers. I am also worried about how good the tracking would be with the Cosmos as well.

It was heaps cheaper than most of the others and it works really well. I need to train up a bit of muscle memory to get my left hand controller back to the right spot after changing mags but I could see I was getting better the more I did it.

Took 6 days to go from order to the UK and delivery to Australia and I've been poppin' sosigs ever since. :)

Vive,GrowRilla’s Next Content Update And Our First Reverse Sale," Hello everyone,

Salmi Games here. At the moment we are preparing for our next content update for our game [GrowRilla](https://store.steampowered.com/app/981880/GrowRilla_VR/). We don’t want to spoil anything just yet, but we have a [sneak peek](https://imgur.com/a/ZrJWkoM) of what you can expect.

With this update, we will raise the price of the game for the first time since we launched in Early Access a few months back. We’ve come to this decision after a lot of back and forth discussion internally, but in the end we feel $15/15€ price point more fairly reflects the value of our game than its original $10/10€.

The other thing we’ve tried to do (ever since our first VR game Late For Work) is to reward players who believed in us and took a chance on our games early in the process. If you supported us early, then you’ve gotten our games at their cheapest possible price. Thank you for your support! We appreciate everyone who’s tried one of our games, left a review or given us feedback.

So if you always wanted to buy the game (which you definitely did right) you can grab it now for $10/10€ or wait a week to get it for 15€! Think of it as a reverse sale.

Did we catch your attention even though you’ve never heard of our game before? You can find out more about our game [here](http://growrillagame.com/).

Thanks for reading. We are happy to answer any questions you may have in the comments.

Cheers,

Vive,Hope you redeemed your code more than a week ago if you pre-ordered the Vive Cosmos.,"I redeemed mine last Friday because I had accidentally paid for a month, and it only gave me 6 Months of Viveport. Here is the customer service response:

    Hi &lt;sirkha&gt;, 
    
    Thank you so much for the prompt reply. My name is Maria and it'll be my pleasure to follow up on your case.
    
    I can imagine this situation can be quite frustrating for you since you were not able to unlock the 12 months VIVEPORT subscription available for the VIVE Cosmos pre-ordered but let me explain to you a bit clearer the previous information. 
    
    I'd like you to think about the redeemable code as a key, a key you have to open a new code with specific features. According to your gift card, I can see you have the key available to use it until 12/21/2021, however, the subscription you unlock will depend on the current promotion you can see in our web page. 
    
    Since the 12 months code was available until 11/05/2019, all the codes redeemed after that date will unlock the present-date promotion, which at this time, is 6 months of VIVEPORT infinity. 
    
    I hope you've useful and clear this information and I'm sorry for the inconvenience. Nevertheless, if you need further assistance or if you have any questions or doubts, please don't hesitate in contacting us again, we will be here ready to help you with everything you might need. 
    
    Enjoy your coming week. 
    Sincerely,
    Maria

So does that mean you can subscribe for $5 a month and cancel anytime, or that its a year subscription, but the cost is $60 instead of $108?

Vive,Advanced Settings 4.0.0 we are in motion again.,"It's been a bit!
 
 
### **Due to safety concerns with how old OVRAS builds don't respond to SteamVR's new chaperone limits we can only recommend Version 4.0.0 at this point.**
This bears repeating. You could have chaperone misalignment with OVRAS 3.2.0 and older on the current SteamVR version. This majorly effects you if you like using our app for space-drag or especially re-directed walking.
Also, Valve changed some API keys, and now old versions will spam errors. This affects everyone.
 
**So now time for the good stuff?**
 
### What is this/Why do I care?
 Advanced Settings is an open-source free Dashboard overlay that is designed to give you access to many useful features.....
PTT, disabling chaperone, ""playspace mover"", ""floor fix"" among many many many many other features... see us on github at [OVRAS](https://github.com/OpenVR-Advanced-Settings/OpenVR-AdvancedSettings)
We try to develop and implement features that the wider vr community wants, (and is within reason XD)  hows our driv..... errr progress?
 
### HELP I HAVE ISSUES! or I just want to chat and ask questions.
 
We have a Discord at [https://discord.gg/vgvSkSk](https://discord.gg/vgvSkSk), can report issues there or help other people with issues
You can also post the issue directly on the Github @ [https://github.com/OpenVR-Advanced-Settings/OpenVR-AdvancedSettings](https://github.com/OpenVR-Advanced-Settings/OpenVR-AdvancedSettings)
As always you can leave your issues here I promise I look at them all.
 
### How Can I help!
 
Vr-er? - come join discord, report issues, test pre-releases, join the ritual to summon valve's flagship vr games!
Developer - come talk to us, do you want to add something.... assuming its within reasonable scope we probably would love to have it in!
Developer with lotsa free time - are you sure you don't want to re-vitalize input emulator it can do things we can't!
But Really what angle? honestly there is none, we love VR just like you all, and like providing the tool. If you really want to leave a donation you can donate to us individually [Kung's Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/join/kungvr), [Ykeara's Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/ykeara)
 
## Highlights of the update:
 
Motion should be fixed for all headsets!
Binding button to take you straight to the binding page
Color Control via gain. (index/vive/vive/pro) (this should have little to no performance penalty unllike overlay method)
offset profiles
pretty icons!
various optimizations.
 
Why 4.0.0 and not 3.3.0? - 4.0.0 is a breaking change, and as such certain old compatibilities will break specifically your old SuperSampling profiles, among some other items. **your keybinds will not be affected**
 
## [Download](https://github.com/OpenVR-Advanced-Settings/OpenVR-AdvancedSettings/releases)

Vive,Best Value Valve index combination?,"Hi,

I’m looking to buy a VR headset and I’m getting one later this year (Oculus Quest). I’m currently 13 years old and I’m gonna be getting a part time job in December (possibly earlier) next year at an IGA, which pays ~$10 AUD an hour, or at a McDonald’s, which from what I know pays ~$15 AUD an hour. All depending on which I may get hired for, if any. Since they aren’t the highest paying jobs, and that I’m also looking to build a PC around the same time, I’m wondering which combination of the valve index will be good for me. On the steam website, there are several different configurations. (Index, Controllers &amp; Lighthouses, Valve index and controllers only, Headset only, controllers only, lighthouses.)

I’m wondering, since the controllers and lighthouses work with the Vive, what configuration of it would be cheaper. 

Thanks!",1573469267.0,8,8,129422

Vive,Lag with hands extended out.,"Ok so this is an odd problem that i have had on and off for a LONG LONG TIME, but seems to have gotten worse recently.  


I just got the knuckles and they seem to be working great but this problem keeps coming up. Ill be playing just about any game, blade and sorcery, pavlov, or anything else standing. About 5 or 10 minutes into playing i will get a huge and i mean MASSIVE spike in lag. Unplayable. If i move my hands down to about my waist line the lag completely goes away.   


This is also accompanied by the steam menu acting oddly, by that i mean my right eye will blink on and off continuously as the whole menu is lagging severely.   


This is incredibly disorienting and ruins my experience quite quickly.   


Also it should be noted that when i play seated games like VTOL VR, i have no issue with this problem. It never surfaces.

Vive,Unpopular Opinion: I don't get the hype around Boneworks,"I am a fan of Stress Level Zero and I want to be hyped about this game. However, I am really confused on why everyone is so excited. I appreciate the amount of work that goes into creating proper physics in VR, but what about this game is more fun than the other VR games out there?

* The story seems like an afterthought, or at the very least we don't know enough to be hyped about it.
* Aside from destructible pieces of the environment, the combat doesn't look that different from other VR shooters out there.

For me a final game is about creating an cohesive experience for the end user, and from what I have seen it looks like they created an excellent physics engine for a game and then tacked on a game.

I want to be wrong, and I want to be excited. So r/Vive, change my mind...

**Edit:**

Based on the comments I now know the points below. It won't personally be a day 1 purchase for me, but I better understand why some people are excited.

\- This is exciting for people with knuckles controllers, so they can finally use them to their potential.  
\- There is still a lack of high quality VR games. So having a game with at least good physics is a step forward, and will encourage other devs to create these types of games.  
\- It will also have puzzles that use the physics.   
\- Combat options are more varied than I have seen... Though I still need to see what kind of crazy stuff I will be able to do.",1573251997.0,14,30,129422

Some players loved them and others just wanted to just keep busting ghosts. We decided to make this a separate optional challenge using a new system we're calling Relic Challenges. We just added it in the latest update which includes slightly re-balanced levels and additional types of these optional challenges to give players more variety in gameplay.

Vive,How The Scoring System Works In Pistol Whip,"When I first tried Pistol Whip at OC6, I was instantly addicted.

## Awesome Guns? Check. Great Rhythm Game mechanics? Check. Superpowers to dodge bullets and take on 100 people in 5 minutes? Check.

## All this wrapped into one epically stylized package that makes you feel badass like you’re John Wick when you play it? Check, check, check

The thing that stood out after playing it (for far too many hours the past couple weeks) was just how many layers of depth there is in it.

When you start out, you’re just learning how to shoot and dodge (basically trying to stay alive while you lament over how sore your legs are from doing so many squats dodging bullets), a little later, you learn how to shoot everything in time to the music and realize how great the flow is in the game, then finally, you learn the details of how scoring works and just go into this flow state each time you return to the game, partly making up your own rhythm each time you play.

Anyway, let’s jump right into how **scoring works** since the tutorial doesn’t cover some of these details.

The game initially ships with 30 leaderboards (10 maps with 3 difficulty leaderboards each).

## 1. Shooting

The aim of the game is accuracy and rhythm (besides Pistol Whips obviously, we’ll get to that). You can get up to 200 points per shot if it’s both:

1. **On beat to the song** (this gives 100 points)
2. **Accurate** (has to hit the enemy anywhere on their body, giving another 100 points)

**a. Accuracy**

By default, there is an “aim assist” activated. Turn this off and you’ll realize just how bad of a shot you are. Even though you may kill enemies if you have bad aim with aim assist on and get *some* points, you’ll still only get full points if your aim was close enough to still hit them.

With a maximum of 100 points, the scoring with aim assist on is calculated by “how much aim assist was needed to help you still hit your target?” This means that you can still kill an enemy with a poor shot (with aim assist’s help) and only get a couple points for your accuracy score.

**b. Timing**

Like most rhythm games, timing is extremely important, giving you half of the possible points from a shot. Unlike other rhythm games like Audica that shows exactly where to shoot and when though, you as the player are responsible for who / where to shoot and when.

When you first start playing, if your gun bullets were a percussion instrument, you’d probably get kicked out of the band. Later, you start to wonder why every band doesn’t have a “pistol player.”

**c. Additional info related to timing**

I had to ask the developers for some of these details. Timing is 150ms for each eighth note — 75ms on either side of the beat. The game lets you follow the beat with a shot within an 8th note, regardless of whether it was technically within the on-beat window. This allows for syncopation and 16th notes and allows you to still get creative with making rhythms with your shots.

## 2. Pistol Whips

Pistol Whips are very satisfying to pull off, but can be challenging at the beginning. For those who don’t know, a pistol whip is when you bash an enemy with your gun (think doing a melee hit in Halo)

To pull off a pistol whip, you have to taunt an enemy in front of you to shoot at you, dodge it, then you’ll need to time how long you have before the enemy reloads and tries to shoot you again, taking him out before he does with a swift hit to the face with your gun.

Killing with a Pistol Whip has a velocity counter, so you get max points for a 4m/s floating average. If your swing has less speed, you’ll earn less points, exponentially. Basically, pretend like the enemy is a Beat Saber block and you’ll be good.

**Why exactly would you want to do a pistol whip, it sounds riskier?** It is in some ways, but it has a payoff. Basically, a pistol whip is one of the easiest ways to guarantee maximum points from killing an enemy. Most likely, if you pistol whip a 4-shot-to-kill enemy with a bit of force, you’ll get 800 points (almost guaranteed, as long as you didn’t shoot them yet). If you shoot a 4 hit enemy twice before doing a pistol whip, you’ll only be able to get the leftover full 400 points with the pistol whip.

One last benefit of a pistol whip is that it reloads your gun and restores your full health. You don’t get additional points (beyond what you’d get if you had perfect shots), but the number of pistol whips you did in a level is also recorded for bragging rights at the end of a song.

## 3. Enemy Types

There’s 3 types of enemies in Pistol Whip.

**1 shot to kill baddies** – These give a maximum of 200 points

**2 shots to kill baddies** – These give a maximum of 400 points

**4 shots to kill baddies** – These give up to 800 points (either with a single pistol whip or 4 shots that all hit their target)

## 4. Modifiers

Modifiers are great ways to change up your gameplay and can allow you to get even higher scores if you disable aim assistant (and also have great aim). You can open up the modifier menu to see more about each one of these and how they affect your score. I’ll try to add some more details on that soon here.

So that pretty much sums up the scoring!

A few last FAQ:

## Are there mods and custom maps?

Not yet, but the devs have a lot of ideas for this and said they’ll make an announcement in a couple weeks at what that could possibly look like. A Beat Saber modeler Sir Raynor helped me mod in a new gun and got their full blessing to do so. New songs are entirely possible, but are a little complicated since there’s a whole level custom created around the song. I could still see a few ways this could work well and I’m excited to hear what the devs announce about it in a couple weeks.

Anyway, hope this was helpful. See you on the leaderboards!

Vive,"Vive HMD not displaying anything, SteamVR losing base stations, help please.","Here's what's happening, also, it's normal for the in game HMD position to be that low, since the base stations are moved from where they usually are. Also I'm aware that it's saying base station drivers are out of date, that's because I flashed it to factory drivers while troubleshooting, that's what those 3 things on the desktop are. Also, I only have one base station plugged in in the recording, because it wouldn't have mattered, the same thing happens at the exact same time as the other one: https://streamable.com/kt323

Things I have done during troubleshooting:

* Disconnected then reconnected

* uninstalled/reinstalled USB drivers

* Completely unplugged everything, including from the link box, then uninstalled and reinstalled USB drivers again.

* swapping out the HDMI cable from the link box

* Running Steam and SteamVR as admin

* power cycling the link box

* I tried directly connecting base stations via USB to check for firmware

* Testing it on my spare laptop that has never had steamVR ever installed on it before to see if it was a driver issue on my PC (Same problem on spare laptop)

* Making sure the things were plugged in on both ends

* Restarted PC after USB driver reinstall, several times

* Reinstalling SteamVR

* Switching to SteamVR Beta (and back again after that didn't work)

* Verifying integrity of the tool cache

* Power cycling base stations

* Directly connecting the HDMI to my PC

* Switching to Direct Mode

* Turning off vive camera

* Turning off Bluetooth

* Closing discord

* Uninstalling OpenVR advanced settings

* Deleting steamVR stuff from appdata for a truly fresh reinstall

* Buying an entirely new 3 in 1 cable after troubleshooting it and not getting any display from the old one's HDMI after plugging my spare laptop into a TV (still same problem)

* Connecting my vive directly to the back of my PC with the HDMI and USB on it sans the power connected to the linkbox which is *required* for power supplying

* Swearing a lot in frustration

What perplexes me is that my HMD is tracking for a set amount of time, but no in headset display is happening. The light on my Vive HMD is green till I turn on SteamVR then it's red. My base station top light remains green even after the crash, which means I can't troubleshoot if it's a base station problem since I literally went as far as to flash the firmware back to factory defaults in case there was a corruption happening and that still didn't fix it. What perplexes me even more is that the same exact problem happened on my spare VR ready laptop despite never plugging my headset into it before ever before now, which means it shouldn't be a driver corruption issue on my desktop I don't think. 

Another thing is that even though my controllers that are wireless, they get straight up disconnected in the short period it takes for the SteamVR viewport to cut out. Based on the desktop viewport of SteamVR they tracked just fine before getting kicked out of the system too; The lights on them go from green to blue in about the same time it takes for steamVR to soft crash, and they get disconnected permanently from this. Happened on both my valve index controllers *and* my vive wands.

Chatting to customer service is like non existent and they keep replying "" we are waiting for confirmation from warehouse"". Anyone returned their cosmos ? If so how long did it take to be refunded.

BEWARE: i will stay well clear of that headset . Not only is the product poor, but the customer service is atrocious to say the least. Never again would i buy anything from HTC

EDIT : So 5+  weeks later still waiting and not a single word from customer service. This to me is pure theft as I have returned their product. Next for me is legal action this has to stop and cant keep going like this . if i was the exception then cool .

Vive,Anyone know where to get thin face gaskets?,"Hello fellow Vivers,

I have a Vive Pro and although I swapped out the face gasket for a comfortable PU pleather gasket, I'm interested in getting the best FOV as possible by getting my eyes nice and close to the lenses. I've found that I can crank the tightness right up to get it fairly snug without any headaches but I feel that if the face gasket were thinner yet, I'd be able to crank out a few more degrees FOV.

Can anyone make some recommendations for really skinny gaskets? TIA.",1573131219.0,25,12,129422

Vive,Short Extension - Vive,"Hi Folks,

Currently have my computer in my computer room with my Vive in my VR room with a pass through on the wall to connect my headset. The cords have always been long enough and I’ve had no issues. Recently I’ve moved my computer to the opposite end of my desk and now the HDMI and the USB are about 3 ft too short to reach my computer. What’s the best solution to extending these cables? I’ve read people are using powered cables but that’s usually for much longer extensions ? (25ft extra)  Can I get away with just a regular extender for these cords?",1573190406.0,1,2,129422

Vive,HTC Cosmos: Lighthouse tracking of controllers?,"I have a Vive Cosmos and a Vive (original). Cosmos quality is excellent. Headset tracking is really really good, far better than Windows inside-out tracking - probably due to more cameras.  However, CONTROLLERS are lost on the games that matter (Beat Saber, RecRoom, even SongBeater). It's frustrating to know you hit a block/sphere or tossed a grenade perfectly, per the original, except for Cosmos losing it unless you are inside 50 degrees of center visual.

I know that, in February, the Cosmos will have an additional $200ish add-on for sale that allows the HEADSET to be seen by the Lighthouses, but the REAL need is for the controllers to be seen by lighthouses.

Q: Are there ANY plans, or even hacks, to improve the controllers, even by lighthouse?",1573153022.0,6,23,129422
Vive,Vive Pro wireless - wired; daily conversion solution,"Hey there,

I've been looking for a solution here several times but as the Pistol Whip release is within few hours the issue is highly relevant to me again.

I swallowed the high price of the Vive Pro and then the even higher price (in comparision) for the wireless module plus adapter ( both original HTC). While performance and picture quality is good enough for me for the typical roomscale game, the FPS and picture quality (flickering, artifacts) using wireless while flying Flightsims (DCS etc) was too bad while at the same time wireless isnt really needed. So I converted my HMD back to wired many weeks ago. 

This way I completley stopped playing roomscale games like Blade and Sorcery. However, there must be a solution where I can simply use my Headset in wired more. Power is not the problem. I would even use power bank while video is wired. However, I havent found a cable +  adapter solution for quickly changing to video via HDMI or DP without opening my HMD (it'll break one day).

Any hints?",1573137660.0,12,12,129422

Vive,Modders have once again SAVED Skyrim! 3 essential VR mods...,"For the unaware, some essential modding has resulted in Skyrim VR actually becoming a really decent VR title. I made this video so you can see...

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jap72TIhgDI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jap72TIhgDI)

The video features a full IK player avatar (painfully missing from the original game), allowing you to see yourself in armor (WTF was this missing from the game Bethesda!?!?!), and voice recognition for the real-time selection of spells and dialogue options.

All three of these mods all but eliminate the constant need to pause the game to access GUI elements, destroying your precious IMMERSION!

VRIK PLAYER AVATAR [https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23416](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23416)

The biggest hole in the original game fixed by modders! Providing  incredible immersion to the player by displaying a first person player  avatar that moves in sync with the players movements, with a full  inverse kinematic upper torso. Comes complete with a 3rd person vanity  mode, displays any armor the player chooses to equip, any race or gender  the player chooses to be, and also featuring the ESSENTIAL  FUNCTIONALITY with a 14 slot fully customisable holster system. Store  and retrieve weapons and tools from almost any position on your in game  body!

WAY OF THE VOICE [https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/16379](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/16379)

Allows for the unlocking and selection of any of the vanilla spells  using VOICE RECOGNITION, further freeing you from the immersion-breaking  torture of the Skyrim GUI.

DRAGONBORN SPEAKS NATURALLY [https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/16514](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/16514)

Speak to any NPC in Skyrim with your own voice, participate in the game  like its a MOVIE by READING THE LINES OF THE SCRIPT! This mod knows  which choice you want by voice recognition. As a bonus effect Way Of The  Voice mod also gains from increased responsiveness if you also install  this mod!

So... if you own Skyrim VR I would highly advise you check out these mods and install them... you'd be doing yourself a big favour!

More information can always be found at /r/skyrimvr , thats where I found out!

Thanks! Message me if you need help or have questions! And have fun!

Vive,Battle Dome is still fun to play if you can schedule 10 players,"So we hold a party last night with  around 10 players，we tried to play some popular games like beat saber and Pavlov together but the gap between skill level is so much. 

We have beat saber player who compete on world leaderboard with players who can't finish expert level songs; we have decent Pavlov player with player who are not into shooting game but can beat anyone in tactic games. We can hardly get a balanced PVP game until we tried battle dome.  For co-op games the maxium number I know is Zomday for 8 players.

The game with CTF mode and color map makes every player contribute to its team even if he's not good at shooting. (In color map, player can only teleport to the painted tiles with their team color. Player can paint the block with a paint gun but then they can't use any powerful two handed weapon) We played for 10+ rounds and everyone felt involved.

So, the last time I used vr was on the GEARVR on my old Samsung phone, I never used vr on pc. and I wanted to ask:

1. In general, for 300$, it worth to buy the cosmos even with all the problems (which probably will be fixed in the future, right?)?
2. the problems that everyone talks about is only on games? or it will be effect me even if i will watch a movie?
3. When i watching a movie, can i do that from any distance i want to or i need to stay close to the pc? there is a distance limitations?

This has the potential to be a killer app and best Karaoke app ever because it puts you on stage singing in front of a huge crowd and it's polished and looks good.

But there's one huge flaw...the audio is garbage.  There's no spatial audio or anything which just kills the immersion.  The game is 2 years old so most likely dead but it's so close to greatness that
maybe if we put enough pressure on the devs they will fix it.

I then unplugged all the cables and tested both the HDMI cables on my PS4 to my TV, both cable worked, I can see my PS4 contents displayed on the TV

The Vive Pro would be far more perfect if there was more space for the nose - if i move the googles outside (like for people who use glasses) i get too much tunnel vision and its not really enjoyable.

Vive,Is there a way to hide or disable the IPD?,"Recently my Vive began to have an issue where if I shook my headset with any kind of force, the IPD would show up as if I were turning the knob. I have messed with the knob so I know it's not just on the cusp of two different settings. It seems like it might be a hardware issue with something loose, but it shouldn't be that big of a deal if I can simply hide or disable the popup message.

I have already tried going to the 'ipdvalue.css' file and editing as many old posts mention as a solution, but there are a couple of weird things.

1. That file didn't exist until I made it, using this link's version of the file: [GitHub](https://gist.github.com/deprecatedcoder/74e65d0d320976f500c533401e9d51a5)
2. Nothing happened when I put it into what I believe is the right spot:  
C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\SteamVR\\content\\panorama\\styles

Does anyone have any ideas on how to fix this? None of the changes I make in that file have any affect on the IPD when it pops up. It's making games pretty much unplayable.

SOLUTION: Courtesy of /r/elvissteinjr

Navigate to: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\SteamVR\resources\webinterface\dashboard\css\systemui.css

Find '.IPDParent' and add: 'display: none;' to it. And that's all there is to it!",1572996106.0,6,19,129422

If anyone is looking at this you have to go into your stream config folder and delete steamvr.vrsettings whole SteamVR is not running. (I’d make a backup somewhere just in case things get screwed up)

Start StramVR and it should reset everything. The only thing is that all your settings including base station power management and controller bindings will get re-set. So make sure you save your controller bindings and remember what your settings are before you do this.

Is it normal to have CPU frame times over 14 Ms on Project Cars 2, for example, even while CPU load is at 40-60% according to fpsVR? It feels like I'm getting performance issues in games despite there apparently being room for the CPU to work harder.

My BIOS settings seem fine, as all the values it detects are accurate, and everything is set to auto. GPU driver is updated. I have no idea what's going wrong. I shouldn't have issues holding 90 fps on a Vive.

Vive,Occasional tracking issues with Index controllers?,"I use lighthouses 1.0, a Pimax 5K+ and Index (Indices?) controllers.

I never had a single tracking problem with Vive wands, 5-stars 100% perfect across the board even on Beat Saber Expert+. Index controllers work fine *for a while*, then eventually become erratic for... a random amount of time.

I used to use Windows 7 and could not install the latest PiTools, but I eventually bit the bullet and downgraded to Windows 10 on a separate HD just to test this. I was thus able to install latest version (1.0.0.180).

The situation improved, but it's not 100% perfect yet. I played Surv1v3 for about an hour, and after about 30 minutes the tracking became so erratic I could not hold a weapon in both hands; going back to the menu and selecting another game mode somehow fixed it.

**QUESTION**

Does anyone else has tracking with Index controllers but not with Vive wands? Is there any way at all to troubleshoot this?

At this point, I suspect that the Pimax headset itself, and more precisely the bluetooth bandwidth with the controllers, could be the reason of this problem.",1572951355.0,4,0,129422

VR E-Sports is missing competitive MOBA games and Cradle of Sins is aspiring to be one. From the early days of developing, we have been working with competing VR gamers who are also taking part in our Alpha testing in order to help shape the game. 

We wish to bring Something that is polished and has a proven track record – a good game that people want to play and will keep playing after weeks of release. We have approached the game with a community first mentality. This has proven successful as we continuously receive constructive feedback from our closed Discord group. They truly have helped us shape the game into what it is today. 

We're about to release the **Official Gameplay trailer** in a couple of days. Made by David Williams (ddubb) and soundtrack composed by an award winning film composer Simone Cilio.

We've recently upgraded our Vive Pro with the wireless kit. So far connection and framerate and picture-quality are as advertised and there's no difference to a wired Vive Pro.

Vive,"None of my ""extra"" dashboard tabs (Advanced Settings, Revive, and Viveport) work anymore.","It's been a few days since I last tried using any of them. I've been doing dev work, so I disabled the chaperone. I'm testing out a new video card I got recently, and tried to disable the chaperone, only to find that the tab is empty. Uninstalling and reinstalling didn't help.

I was ultimately able to re-enable the chaperone by editing steamvr.vrsettings in the Steam install directory and setting CollisionBoundsFadeDistance back to 0.7, which seems to be the default, but I still have the problem of the 3 tabs being empty.

The only thing that's different on my PC since the last time I tried using those tabs is the video card I installed earlier today. It only has 1 HDMI port, so I gave it to the Vive, since I don't have any DisplayPort adapters. I plugged both of my monitors into the motherboard to use the integrated graphics card.

I have a DisplayPort to HDMI cable arriving in a few days, so I'll know for sure if that's the problem, but is there anything else I might be able to do to get these tabs to work, if that isn't the solution? It seems pretty odd for 3rd-party SteamVR dashboard tabs not to work if there are no monitors plugged into the discrete graphics card.

Edit: I tried playing Project Cars 2. The game refused to display in VR. When I started a race, I could look at the game responding to the headset's motion, but the VR view wouldn't actually show up in the headset, and I saw a warning pop up on the SteamVR app saying to plug the headset into the same video card as the primary monitor.

H3VR doesn't have this problem, though, so... bad programming?

Edit 2: fpsVR's tab works fine, also. I'm really thinking this has something to do with some code trying to target a specific GPU or display somehow, and getting screwy when the assumption that the monitor and headset are plugged into the same card turns out to be false. I'll find out when I get an adapter tomorrow.

Edit 3: Plugging my main monitor into the same GPU as the headset, rather than the motherboard, by using an HDMI to Display port adapter fixed all the empty tabs as well as PCars 1 and 2. I don't understand it, but I accept it.",1572852986.0,18,9,129422

Vive,Any OBS tips for VR streaming setup? (Want to avoid frame skipping lag),"So I have my non-vr setup dialed in pretty well so that it doesn't frameskip (Different from dropping frames or lagging) by keeping about 5% of the GPU overhead available to OBS at any given time when streaming. I'm worried that moving to VR is going to tank the GPU though, and assuming I'll need to redo my setup to get decent quality. Here's where I'm currently at:

* Ryzen 1700x OC'd to 3.7ghz
* 1060 6gb OC'd to \~2115 GPU core &amp; \~4680 Mem Clock

SLOBS (Streamlabs obs ) @:

* Base canvas size 1080
* Scaled output 720 bicubic
* 48fps
* x264 CBR 4000 bitrate
* Cpu preset faster
* x264 options opencl=true
* Recording x264, cbr 8000, veryfast, nonscaled
* Slobs set at high priority cpu process

Now, I ***do*** have a vega 64, but I need to RMA it and get a 2060 super or a 5700 xt because it has some serious throttling problems at low resolutions and won't undervolt correctly. (Check my post history if you want to learn more.) So for now, that option is out.

Things I think I can do:

1. Switch to NVEC as the primary encoder to force SLOBS to prioritize the gpu before the game eats it up.
2. Change my x264 preset to veryfast

Things I'm afraid I might have to:

1. Switch to Regular OBS to free up some processor resources bc slobs is hungry
2. Drop the resolution of my local recordings
3. Change my canvas size
4. Edit: I forgot about the option [from my last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Vive/comments/9wgwni/twitch_streaming_problems_with_1060_i53570_slobs/) of using a second rig. I still have my i5 + 970 from last year laying around.
5. Edit 2: ~~Another crazy option - I could put the vega in the second pcie8x slot and dedicated to encoding?~~ I'm told this doesn't work.

Vive,Hey! Question about the wireless power bank!,"So I love my wireless Vive. It was so easy to setup and looks great, though admittedly my Rift S had a nicer display. Anyways, I've been looking into a solution for the low battery life. The issue I'm running into is that I have a 3D Printed holder that I bought that only fits batteries of the official sized ones. So I'm looking for something that is bigger in capacity but the same size as the original battery. Was wondering if anyone had found anything similar that would work. 

I understand it needs to be QC 3.0 to actually work with the Wireless adapter and so far, this is the best option I've found even though it's a bit pricy: [https://www.amazon.com/Grapheme-Wireless-Portable-20000mAh-High-Speed/dp/B07Y9S4WCY/ref=sr\_1\_12\_sspa?keywords=QC+3.0+power+bank&amp;qid=1572788852&amp;sr=8-12-spons&amp;psc=1&amp;spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEyU0w0NlM0SDhLWDFNJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwNjk3NzE3NjdPNkNCTE8yVDROJmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTAxNTg2NDMxNUJPUU5IVDQ2T1dVJndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfbXRmJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ==](https://www.amazon.com/Grapheme-Wireless-Portable-20000mAh-High-Speed/dp/B07Y9S4WCY/ref=sr_1_12_sspa?keywords=QC+3.0+power+bank&amp;qid=1572788852&amp;sr=8-12-spons&amp;psc=1&amp;spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEyU0w0NlM0SDhLWDFNJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwNjk3NzE3NjdPNkNCTE8yVDROJmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTAxNTg2NDMxNUJPUU5IVDQ2T1dVJndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfbXRmJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ==)

Vive,Play all retro games in VR,"Hi guys,

Some of you might see this as old news but only recently i found this and i guess that not everyone here found it already so i'd like to help you guys with how to get EmuVR. It's free btw.

 [http://www.emuvr.net/](http://www.emuvr.net/)  On the website are instruction to get to the download.

You can play all retro consoles on several old tv's, even old dos games, psx and much more. Just like in real life you have to connect the cables, plug in the game cassette or cd's, press the ON buttons, ... You can decorate your room with custom posters, wallpapers, floors, bedsheet, you can even add the pictures/logo's on the cassettes/cd's. It's really cool if you're a fan of retro games.

If you wanna figure out how to get everything working in emuvr i suggest you'd watch these short video's in the developer's playlist  [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLl8MHzvg8QAIALb8WNz-3ttdKfkMiBp-L](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLl8MHzvg8QAIALb8WNz-3ttdKfkMiBp-L) 

It took me quiet some time to put all the pictures on each cassette ect but here is my room in case you wanna see how my virtual room looks like :D [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=075FKPRMfTc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=075FKPRMfTc)

Vive,[Help!] Trackpad (not click related) registers constant touch.,"On one of my controllers, the trackpad registers a constant touch in the 10 o’clock position without my thumb touching it. It clicks down absolutely fine and any other input on the trackpad over rights it. In the SteamVR menu, where you can see you controller, there is a definite dot indicator on the trackpad in the same position.

Resetting the controller fixes problem for a few minutes then will come back a while after. Very annoying in games like Pavlov where it snaps direction and I end up spinning around in circles until I vomit onto my carpet.

Vive,Oculus Rift CV1 vs HTC Vive used?,"

So I really want to get into VR, and im thinking about getting a used rift or vive.
What do you guys suggest? I have never experienced vr before, should I get the rift or the vive? And what is a good price for it? Currently they seem to be going for around £450-499 new.
I found a used rift CV1 (marvel edition) for £180, and most of the used vives are around £200-300.

Thoughts?

Vive,HTC Vive Pre?,"Hi All,

Is there any functional difference between the HTC Vive and HTC Vive Pre? I found a really cheap HTC Vive on facebook marketplace (only 200$), the only difference I noticed between a regular Vive and this headset was the different power plugs, as these had european ones. The seller said he got it as a present from work 2 years ago, but never used it, and if I have any problem with it, he will take it back.

I bought it and brought it home now, and I noticed an HTC VIVE PRE label on the controllers. After a little googling, the only things I found out about the Pre are that they were made a few months before the regular ones for developers, but has the exact same specs as the regular vive. The headset and controllers really look like they were never used before, the base stations even have the foils still on, and there are some unopened bags with cables in the box. If this is functionally the same as a regular Vive, I would like to keep it, as I don't think I could get anything as good as this for a similar price. 

Do you know, if the base stations and controllers for the Pre are working same as the regular Vive? So can I upgrade to a Vive Pro or Pimax headset later, without needing to buy a pair of new base stations and controllers too?",1572656343.0,6,6,129422

Steam is closed, nothing in the taskbar, nothing in task manager even when expanded to show all tasks.

As an extra precaution, I tried closing all Oculus software, Viveport, and a bunch of other things, but the message persists and whenever I click ""Continue"" it just comes back.

I tried restarting, I tried reinstalling Viveport, I even tried changing the name of my Steam folder in which SteamVR is already installed, so that setup would not be able to find any files (and presumably do a clean install), but it still gives the same error.

I spoke to a friend who had the same issue, even tried it on a machine on which Steam had never been installed, and he still got the error, but after a few days it went away and he could finally use the headset.

Vive,I bought my vive pro back after 3 months struggle with Index,"I sold my vive pro after I receive my index full set, I really like its controller(which made most revive games not only playable but enjoyable) and the audio is much more stable, no need to play with microphone or headphone setting in steamvr anymore. 

But, the LCD screen is a nightmare as I played Skyrim and Beat Saber most of the time. Black level is terrible no matter how I adjust brightness in steamvr setting. It makes everything unreal and blurry in certain games.  When I bought Index I thought it will only affect visual quality in some dark scene, but in reality even my steamvr home is quite blurry and washed out, Beat Saber felt even worse than my Quest. I thought I will get used to it someday since it did slightly improved visual quality in apps like Pavlov and virtual desktop, but I didn't. I almost burst into tear when I switch back to OLED screen yesterday.  It seems that when supersampling is higher than 1.5 on a 3K screen, the black level is more important than 50% extra subpixels provided by LCD screen. Although I have to admit that I didn't take advantage of Index's 120 Hz flash rate because I can only run my modded SkyrimVR at 90fps The Havok value has to be changed for 120Hz and it causes trouble. Also even with a 2080Ti graphic card and 8700K CPU, you cannot supersampling in most games while running at 120Hz refresh rate. If steamvr could have an option to run apps in different refresh rate, I may use 120Hz in some well optimized games like Superhot or Beat Saber.

I have a friend who also upgrade from Pro to Index, he's using a GTX1080(Supersampling at 1.1 at 90hz) and prefer to play shooting games like Pavlov. For him the Index is an upgrade on every aspects, whether is audio or visual quality. So it really depend on the game you play.

I will still keep my Index for local multiplayer on a second desktop (goodbye my old rift), but I will use Pro as my main headset at the moment.",1572568415.0,17,27,129422
Vive,HTC Vive - Single / Screen issue's [ Green 1 - 4 Pixels Sparkles / Green 1- 2 pixel wide lines / Flashing white with other colors ],"&amp;#x200B;

\- Ok let's start ( Problems/issues that are happening )

1. Green pixels sparkles popping up randomly around the screen ( Also might look like they are white ) ( Each one comes and goes with in less than a second ) their can be many of these or their can be very few of these
2. Thin Green line appearing near the middle of both screens leaving within less than a second happening way less often as the green sparkles do
3. Bottom part or full screen turn mostly white/ mixed a couple other coloured pixels ( most likely the game single still getting thru a little ) This last less than a second but can happen a couple of times in a row really fast and is not always their
4. Screen wicks out like your going cross eyed ( Stays like this intel you restart the headset ( turning off and turning back on steam Vr )

\------------------------------------------------------

Things that I have tried

* Unplugging and replugging all the cables ( HDMI, Power , USB ) have unplugged all and replugged all making sure they are clean - **No results**
* Checked cable for knots or damage that is visible - **Nothing**
* Made sure all connections are in good - **Nothing**
* Turning steam vr direct view mode off - **Stops number 3. from happening also mostly stoped green spakles and lines but not always**

Other notes all these problems are fixed or at least for the time By keeping SteamVr direct view mode turned off also ( maybe from the headset being warm( Thinking maybe the cold weather is acting it up room get really cold )) also when the cable is elevated ( Cable management ) Not sure going to try again

Problem Started 10/29/2019 - Came when playing Vrchat and got it to go away again 45 mins later and worked for the rest of the night

Problem continuous 10/30/2019 - Turned on problem is still their did testing to figure out what the issue is got it to go away with the stuff above - later tested turning Direct view mode back on did the same thing turned it back off it stopped

11/1/2019 Going to do more test maybe also buying a replacement 3 in 1 cable

\-------------------------------------

From what i have found and looked up over the internet, it seems like the 3 in 1 cable has a lot of issues ( did not know about this until I started researching a lot ) Something to do with the hdmi cable itself not being able to support it anymore and it has lost a single one of the hdmi line ( don't know what they are called ) so im going to buy a new 3 in 1 cable and also do further testing and update this more once the 3 in 1 cable comes i will test it and update and say if it fixed it or not

Ps. The problem happens in steam vr and other games also ( Pavlov , steam Vr , Vrchat ) for testing all do it again seems like a single issue or software issue

Vive,"Tea For God, new build (0.4.0)","Hi guys!

Finally, the first update that introduces new stuff to the gameplay. Following updates should be more often and probably I will be posting short videos with them (similar to the one that is posted here).

[First, check the video with the features.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRhpLvWiegc)

What's new?

Extension modules. These are the things you will be unlocking, finding and putting on your forearms to get better stats, more features, etc. Some of them will be just straight-forward upgrades. Some will upgrade one thing but will have side effects on others. Some will be more convenient but will take more place. For now, there is just a bunch that shows different types of EXMs. It is still a quite few of them and you may find filters on the left side useful. They don't look amazingly detailed but having a colour code for them and making it easier to read them without checking info was the priority. Boosters are round, active EXMs are grey, reactor is yellow, health is red and so on.

In this version, all EXMs are unlocked but soon I will be working on a persistence layer. But more on that later.

Extension modules fall into a few categories:

* boosters - they just improve stats
* passive - for now, this is just navigation and energy pulling (although energy pulling requires input). One of the things I want to add is ""auto-convert"" that will turn any nearby NPC that can be converted into your ally.
* active - here is where the most fun is as you use them during the game. You have to select them by pointing at them with your finger and then you activate with a button press.

And here's a short story behind one active EXM. There were a few people who said that Tea For God reminds them of Another World. I thought why shouldn't I add a shield that works in a very similar way to Another World's shield? So there it is (A/SHLD-S).

There are just five active EXMs now and as it comes to the functionality, these are just three types: attractor, deflector, shield. The attractor is useful to get the enemy's attention (or your robodog). The deflectors may render you untouchable. All incoming energy projectiles are deflected - they turn to not hit you. There are two deflectors: long-range and short-range. And finally, two shields. One that is bound to your hand, and other that you may place anywhere.

No, there is no tutorial but as soon as I feel that the core gameplay mechanisms are complete, I'd like to add some tutorial levels. With the final game, I am still considering whether to add tutorials into the game (which is good because you learn on the way, but bad because it may be distracting and you may not pay attention) or add them as something suggested when you die (then, the game would have to know what to suggest and why). The advantage of the latter is that you may experiment in the tutorials and learn stuff without any distractions around. One thing I am sure, I don't want to explain stuff with text - I'd like to get rid of ""learn basics"" as soon as possible.

There are so many things I'd love to throw into the game right now. I have dozens of ideas for levels, enemies, EXMs, weapon types, features (puzzle machines, the persistence layer which will include a few mini-games on its own). But I want to focus on the core gameplay and the content will have to wait a bit.

Oh, a word about the video. There is no commentary and it may seem to be rushed, especially in the first part. I just didn't want it to drag for too long. There are just glimpses of functionality and very short explanations with some of the stuff to discover on your own (like hot-cold navigation which I prefer). The video was taken using Vive (with tpcast) and Oculus Rift. With PCVR I added extra info on the screen (that was mostly to change the aspect ratio of the main view. But works nicely as a more inside view into the energy levels etc. Actually, I am now thinking about allowing someone else to sit at the keyboard to allow manipulating stuff (selecting EXMs, transferring energy, changing navigation targets (because that will be coming!)). This will alter your loadout as you may not require transfer buttons on your forearms and may have more stuff. Added that to todo list. Asymetric coop.

What else?

Have fun and let me know what you like, what you don't like, what would you like to have in the game.",1572271438.0,48,7,129422
Vive,Vive crashing since today,"For some reason launching SteamVR causes my PC to crash when my Vive is connected since this morning.

Vive,Updated reviews on prescription lens adapters?,"Hey folks.  Recently picked up a Vive and while it's manageable to wear my glasses while I play, it's not an ideal long gaming solution as I find the glasses occasionally get pushed into my eye and smudge.  I'd much rather go with one of the prescription lens adapter solutions that are out there.

Big question is, which one?  I've seen VR Lens Lab, vr-lens.eu, and WIDMOvr all reviewed and talked about, but nothing within the last year or two.  Curious to know how all 3 of these companies have adjusted to the reviews they've gotten and how they stack up against each other now.

Vive,Indie developed Monster Hunting VR Roguelike Game coming to Steam on October 30th - Monster Reapers VR,"Hey Everyone.

We're a two man indie developer team which has been working on a Monster Hunting VR Roguelike called Monster Reapers VR for a while now and it's about to release on steam early access.  
We started out wanting to make a game similar to Luigis Mansion, but we soon recognized even though the mechanics are fun, it wasn't enough to make a game that will be engaging for a long time.  
We started implementing Roguelike and dungeon crawling elements to make it more diverse and also spiced up the combat by adding new weapons and abilities.  
One hand will be your weapon hand and the other hand uses magic. It is heavily inspired by bioshock and we plan on also adding ways to use the elements to interact with environments and such.

Vive,Quality of Life Improvements.,"I'm slowly improving my Vive quality of life.  I've fixed several issues like my cable wrapping around itself in use, but I can't think of any way to make the Vive fit better.

I've adjusted the head piece as the instructions say and the Vive sits well on most slow gameplay, but game where I'm ducking or making fast movements the headset begins to slip and fall.

I'm funding myself throwing a hand up to reset the headset in place several times a song in beat saber and it's beginning to be a major annoyance and potential hazard to the system.  I'm assuming the cause is the back strap sitting at the back top of my head while worn instead of lower down like most masks.

I’ve been wondering if I could use a thunderbolt connection for the problem, but still not sure how. Any advice would be appreciated.",1572334694.0,1,4,129422

Vive,DETAILED GUIDE: Half-Life 2 Campaign in VR (via Garry's Mod),"**Introduction:** 

* Recently I played through Lambda1VR (HL1) on Quest, and loved it. As soon as I finished, I wanted to continue in to HL2. This was the best method I found, and I’m happy to say that I **loved** it! It was a fantastic, epic experience, even with all the technical and configuration challenges. 
* Would highly recommend it to any serious fans. Turns out the gravity gun is pretty fun in VR – who knew. 
* I probably spent about 12-15 hours in the campaign, and another 5 or so hours messing around with stuff to get it working. 
* This guide is intended to reduce the time you spend messing around, so that you can get more time in the game and complete Half-Life 2 completely in Virtual Reality. 

**Requirements:** 

* Garry’s Mod + HL2 in Steam – Garry’s Mod was a cheap $12 for me, though I have no interest in it other than for this application. 
* VR Legs / Iron Stomach – I don’t ever feel sick, but there are some moments here that will **test you**. The airboat is the biggest offender by far, but I think there may have been a few other moments that I can’t specifically recall – **be cautious if you are prone to sickness, and consider leaving this for when your VR legs improve.**
* Patience – The game plays through from start to finish more or less perfectly, but this is an enthusiast/diehard experience and completely unfit for people who aren’t willing to roll their sleeves up. 

**How to Install / Play:**

1. Make sure you have Half-Life 2 and Garry’s Mod installed on Steam.
2. Navigate to the Workshop for Garry’s Mod and install “VRMod - Experimental Virtual Reality” and “Half-Life 2 Campaign Content” mods. (note: I’m not sure if the campaign content mod is strictly necessary).
3. Enable DSR Super-Sampling through your [NVIDIA Control Panel 3d Settings](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/dynamic-super-resolution-instantly-improves-your-games-with-4k-quality-graphics/) (DSR Factors – might as well click ‘em all as far as I can tell – this allows supersampling)
4. Launch Steam VR.
5. Launch Garry’s Mod (you will get a warning, disregard)
6. Increase the resolution in the Garry’s Mod Video menu. SteamVR resolution settings do not work – you must change them manually (how high you go depends on your video card. On a 1080Ti, I used 3325 horizontal.)
7. Start a new game and select HL2 from the options. 
8. If you are starting for the first time, choose d1\_trainstation\_01 – they are NOT in correct order, rather they are alphabetical. If you want pick up where you’ve left off, you can find the correct map order [**here**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Vive/Point%20Insertion)**.** (Note: it can be difficult to make out the text at very high resolutions, so you might want to get a feel for where your map is prior to increasing resolution). 
9. Choose start game. You will spawn with all the appropriate weapons for that map in the game, typically with a full clip and one extra per weapon. 
10. To activate VR, hold down **“Q”** on the keyboard – this will open the Garry’s Mod VR in-game menu. Navigate to the **“utilities”** section, and the “**VRMod”** entry will be at the bottom of the list. 
11. Make sure you check “Automatically load VR when you start a new map” (towards the bottom) so that you can skip this step in future sessions. You can also select HMD/Controller oriented movement, as well as a few others. Avoid the ‘world models’ for wepaons, they don’t work right. 
12. Click “Start VR” and enjoy Half-Life 2. 

I used the following [youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjmN9wt7h5Q&amp;feature=emb_title) to get myself started, so props to them and please consider viewing it if you are having trouble with any of the above steps. 

**There is NO Saving, so what happens when I die/quit?** 

if you die, you have two or three options, depending. 

1. **Restart:** If you really care about not cheating, the best bet is usually to fully exit gmod and restart at the beginning of whichever map you died on. Each map is relatively short, and this isn’t a significant problem. Just be cautious, take things slowly/seriously and you’ll be fine. You will lose your ammo as a penalty for death, but you are given enough at the start of the map to be able to make it comfortably. This can be a pain, but reloading the map without restarting often seems to break things (or did for me). 
2. **Respawn:** You can also respawn, but you will respawn in that same instance - with all the NPCs who were dead, still dead, etc. If a door opened in the beginning of the map, but is now closed, you might be barred from going through. You can noclip through and usually be fine though. If you want to emulate 'checkpoint saving' and dont care too much about the purity of your run, this is probably the simplest option to advance in the game. You will spawn without weapons, and so either need to pick them up in the map, or give them to yourself through the “Q” menu in Garry’s Mod. 
3. **Kill Key NPC:** Finally, if you happen to be accompanied by an important NPC, their death will be game over. When you respawn, this will be a clean level load for some reason and everything will work. So if something glitches and you want to start fresh, just kill Barney or Alyx with a combine ball, which is the most effective immediate KO. 

**Setting Up Controls:**

* Many of the default controls assume you are playing Garry’s Mod, and so the mapping can be improved. I used Vive Wands, and used this  [layout](https://imgur.com/a/BEPMzpH) , you can download my [SteamVR Input export](http://s000.tinyupload.com/index.php?file_id=23776465543963730812). It was also saved in the community bindings, but I have not been able to access those recently. Further note, I think my controls could be further improved for sure, so if anyone works on a better default, I will post theirs here. 
* If you’re using other controllers, my export isn’t working for you, and you’re not already familiar with SteamVR Input mapping, this is a good time to get your feet wet. You can basically rebind everything to your liking. 
* One input that is valuable for troubleshooting is the Garry’s Mod “Q” Menu. This is a menu that you want occasionally, but don’t need quick access to. I created a chord (left menu, left grip) to open this menu in the Steam Input Settings. 

**Control Tips:**

* **Using objects:** To “use” something, the 'action point' that determines whether you can activate something is at the end of the right hand - but not just the hand, its the model. If you have the empty hands/crowbar etc, the action point becomes the centre of your HMD. 
* **Flashlight:** Your flashlight will come out of your right hand as well. You will notice *significant* performance drops when the flashlight is on in some environments. I’m sure this can be tweaked or modified in the video settings. 
* **Aiming Melee/Grenades**: To aim crowbars and grenades, use your HMD - not your right hand. Don’t know why this is the case, but it is. The centre of the flashlight can help you to aim the crowbar. 
* **Aiming Guns:** For some guns, the iron sights are somewhat workable (i.e. pistol), on others (i.e. SMG) they’re not reliable. The combine gun doesn’t even have sights! Consider this a flavor-win…if you just picked up an alien gun, maybe it wouldn’t be setup with your ease of use in mind. That said, I found a consistent way to sight even the combine gun, and I’m sure you can too!
* **Who you talkin’ to?:** You may notice some of the NPC’s staring at the floor when they talk to you – that’s because they are talking to the end of your gun/right hand. You can solve this by either switching to empty hands/crowbar etc, or holding your gun’s barrel to your own face – or, as many of the game’s quirks, by ignoring and accepting this defect. 
* **Weapon Wheel:** If you're not familiar with the weapon wheel, it works by scrolling clockwise or counterclockwise to advance. It's not the best for large inventories, but honestly by the end I didn’t mind it. 
* **Ladders:** OK, so ladders seem crazy and almost made me tear my hair out – but actually, they work fine. also ladders are crazy. you will think they are incredibly broken and janky, but heres the process: you walk up and get your right hand in the proper distance to activate (if the activation point goes through the ladder, it wont work. Usually you can be pretty far from things, so err on the side of being farther away. AFTER YOU ACTIVATE THE LADDER, put both your hands in the air above your head.  You probably only need one of them, probbaly the right hand, or it might even be controller orientation,  but I always put my hands up and it worked everytime. To get off the ladder, 'use' it again. you'll almost always pop on to whatever surface you need to. 
* **Vehicles:** The Vehicles use their own separate bindings, and for the most part they work fine – but keep in mind, the mounted weapons are completely, irreparably broken. Do not bother trying to fix them, you can’t. The mounted weapon seems to have a fixed relative orientation. I.e. it’s relative to the world, not to you or your controllers. Also like three different inputs have an influence in the way they aim. I actually managed to defeat the helicopter in the airboat despite this, but It basically meant that you always had to attack from the same direction – hard to explain, but the long-story short is: forget about them and don’t waste two hours of your life like I did. 
* **Q Menu:** The “Q” Menu in Garry’s Mod allows you to give yourself weapons, change settings in the VRmod, and spawn items/objects. This can occasionally be useful to get around glitchy areas, give yourself a weapon after respawning, or others. 

**Places you** ***will*** **get stuck (spoilers):** 

There are several sections that are outright broken and require workarounds, but luckily I have already figured them all out for you. Here they are in order of appearance:

* **The Water Trap:** During the d1\_canals\_01a you will be going through a long tunnel when you will find a pool of water. It can be difficult to get out of this and continue on. I would guess that most people who brave this mod and quit, quit here. I spawned some extra boxes and pallets, and then used those to help me jump up. I think that if you ‘raise your arms’ above your head while you try to get out, it might work for the same reason it works on ladders. Last resort, open the console and ‘noclip’ to get up. 
* **Vehicle Combat:** The gun doesn’t reliably work on the airboat or the car. During **Route Kanal** you will need to destroy an attack helicopter. Just spawn yourself an RPG with the “Q” Menu. It is possible to kill it with the gun (I did it) but in retrospect I wish I had just cheated my way through. You never need the gun on the buggy, so just ignore it. 
* **Ravenholm:** d1\_town\_03 is actually several maps and I believe is the only instance in which you will ‘load’ into the same map, and not the next one. This confused me the first time. This makes it annoying as you have to do all the sections in one go (or else clip/cheat through). If you do decide to respawn/cheat through to get to your old position, you will have to trigger all the scenes with the old man who helps you, as the level will not progress if the scenes have not triggered. 
* **Alyx in City 17:** The map d3\_citadel\_6b, where you meet back up with Alyx, has messed up spawns. If you load in from the previous level, and don’t die during this chapter, then you won’t even notice. But if you start directly from this map, or if you try to respawn in any way, you will definitely notice. It seems to be spawning randomly (multiplayer spawns???) and you will have to noclip back to the very beginning of the level, and then proceed normally to trigger the cutscene with Alyx and continue from there. 
* **Super Gravity Gun:** When you load into d3\_citadel\_03, you will be stripped of your weapons but you will not receive the super gravity gun. You need to download an addon to get it then give it to yourself in the “Q” menu.  You might find that your aim is now attached to your HMD – this is because the gun will take its Aim orientation from whichever weapon you had last (i.e. HMD if crowbar/hands/grenades, Right hand if gun). So if you switch to it from the machine gun (should be able to find one on the first combines or in Q menu) it will go back to normal. You will also find that your gun model might now be screwed up – no fix for this that I’m aware of, but it won’t impact gameplay. I don’t recommend installing this addon until later, as it will clutter up your menu and can screw up gun models when it’s not necessary. 
* **Episode 1 / Episode 2:** They just don’t work. Sorry. I ended up playing them flat. Was disappointing! If anyone does know how to get them working for a full playthrough, please let me know!!!

Apologies if there are any errors (which I'm sure there are at least a couple). I will update to incorporate corrections/suggestions/better tips/etc as they come in from the comments.

In the meantime, for all the brave souls who choose to take on the Combine in City 17 - good luck",1575926331.0,149,21,129422

Vive,Highly recommend Onward for anyone who plays Pavlov and Contractors,"Just a headsup because I know a lot of people who play VR shooters don't play more than 1-2 games regularly, and I think a lot of people would like this. 

Onward, for those who don't know, is the most realistic shooter in VR and one of the big three (Pavlov, Onward, Contractors). The Devs are very intent on it being a realistic MilSim so you're not going to get TTT or anything too comical (although it does have RPGs, Drones, C4, and stun guns). But it also means the game's tension, gunplay, and personal physics are unmatched. The primary mode is based on search and destroy so you don't respawn, and the game is all about positioning, directional audio, and flanking. There are more guns and attachments and there are dedicated classes, and sniper mechanics are better with both aim and scope smoothing that reduces tracking and hand jitter without making the game too easy. There are side sights and hybrid scopes, and the game makes you balance your loadout points between different attachments, body armor, grenades, or pistols.

You can definitely play both this and Pavlov or Contractors, but if you play Pavlov and prefer playing pure combat modes like Search and Destroy then Onward is perfect for you. I played over 200 hours of Pavlov but Onward just feels a lot better for pure combat modes and no weapons feel OP or terrible. Maps are huge and spotting enemies and figuring out their spawn is a big part of it, which also makes sniper rifles really viable. When you compare just combat and gunplay Onward feels like Pavlov 2.0, even if it is less forgiving. I also do a lot more crouching and evading in this.

Onward has modded maps (no rules or mode mods), although because it was sold on the Oculus store as well they don't use steam workshop. This means mods are little bit of a pain to download right now but the game doesn't lean on mods as much as pavlov. Onward also has other modes like Gun Game, One in the Chamber, and Spec Ops, but those are only available in private lobbies if they aren't the ""social mode"" of the month. It also has higher hardware requirements but the graphics look better in my view, and things like lighting and shadows look better with very little text when you're in combat that distracts you by becoming pixelated at a distance. It has a single player/co op mode where you hunt or escape AI who are really hard, maybe too hard.

It gets updated a fair amount, new custom maps come out steadily, etc. A quest version is reportedly on the way but I have no idea how that will be. There is a dedicated community and around ten lobbies even after midnight, with a lot of Pacific and European players, and a recent sale boosted player numbers a lot.",1575888262.0,93,107,129422
Vive,Vive FOV Values: For Unity Shader (s),"Heya brothers and sisters! First time poster, long time lurker.

While working on a shader I needed the horizontal and vertical FOV values; the search lead me here.
I found a thread where people were looking for the same, but there was no answer, so I dug into Unity and found the internal values.

Horizonal FOV: 106.0971
Vertical FOV: 111.7577

Vive,Gorillaz Inspired VR Experience in Development - Help Us Bring it to Life!,"Hi, I'm Jake. I'm a VR developer from Sydney, Australia. Earlier this year I released my first music VR project INTERSTELLA VR - A Daft Punk inspired experience. Watch the video or download it here: [jakedonaldsonvr.com/interstellavr](http://jakedonaldsonvr.com/interstellavr).

It created waves on the internet and received a lot of media attention, including articles from [Road To VR](https://www.roadtovr.com/daft-punk-vr-one-more-time-fan/), [EDM.com](https://edm.com/news/daft-punk-vr), and [DJ Mag](https://djmag.com/news/daft-punk%E2%80%99s-%E2%80%98one-more-time%E2%80%99-has-been-turned-vr-rave-watch).

Next I'm looking to produce a no-budget **GORILLAZ** inspired VR project based on the music video for [FEEL GOOD INC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyHNuVaZJ-k). It will be an immersive, interactive experience to be played on 6DOF headsets, like Vive, Rift and (potentially) Quest.

Vive,VR Game Idea (Nowhere else to post?),"Hey, Recently I was quite bored. So I wrote up an entire VR game plot in 2 hours. Don't you just hate it when you write a game, I do. Anyway, my game ""idea"" is called Cube-ustry (Mashup of cube, and industry, corny I know.)

Quick run-down
You start in a white void, infront of you is a gray desk, and three cube shaped holes, (Each hole had a colored sticker next to it. Red, Green, and Blue.) behind you is a chute/dispenser that appears to stretch into infinity.

""Hello"" the narrator greets.

""Welcome to your workplace, please state your name out loud.""

*Player presumably says name*

""Just kidding, I don't actually care. Your Employee #002.""

*Fax machine like sound plays from behind you, as a red cube falls out*

""Please grab the RED Cube and place it into the RED slot.""

Two events will trigger base on different reactions

*If player puts the cube in the red slot* (String 1)

""Good Good, You got this.""

*Fax like sound plays again, a green cube falls out this time. You get prompted with the same message as before""

""Please grab the GREEN Cube and place it into the GREEN slot.""

*if player puts it in*

""Great! You've got the hang of things, i'm sure you can figure the next thing out.""

*Fax Sound plays, once again. And a blue cube falls out of the chute, and the narrator says nothing.*

That is the main story, here is an additional part. 


*If player doesn't do as asked, for any cube insertion*
(StringF)

""As I said, put the (cubenamewillvaluebasedonevent) cube in the (^) slot.""

*If ignored again*

""I am simply an automated response system, I have no problem repeating forever""

Message will just repeat from now on


*If player doesn't do as asked*
(String2)



Main story continues:

*If final cube is placed in, 'blue'*

""There you go. You've got this, im sure you don't need my help anymore. Good luck Employee #002!"" 

""Oh, and heres a little gift.""

*A opening becomes visible on the top of the board and an 4 digit counter, like the ones you see on a calculator or alarm clock pops out*

""The more you get right, the higher the counter goes to. Get one wrong, and you lose a point. You may get rewards for good preformance""

*A random colored cube spawns*

From now on, you just put cubes in and get higher scores, if you put one in you lose a point and the cube gets launched out of the slot.

(Any devs who are willing to attempt this game can add easter eggs at this point, like for example 1337 cubes might give you a computer or something. Just random stuff, you can honestly do whatever you want :)

(If you reach 9999 the counter should reset and the narrator should pop in a 
""Wow, thats alot of cubes! If you weren't a simulation I would have promoted you.""


ACT 2 (The accident)

Upon wandering too the back of console (the machine that you put cubes into) there's a red button with a glass case around it, this case only opens when you finish the tutorial, aka when he stops talking to you.

If the button gets pressed, the narrator will say:

""Oh no, you shouldn't have pressed that. Didn't I tell you not to press buttons? No? Oh, oops.""

*The chute dispenses a purple cube*

""Gah! Don't pick that up, leave it there. I'll fix this,  just give me a moment, DO NOT PUT IT IN THE SLOTS.""

*if player leaves it for like 10 seconds*

""There, I have re-routed the button controls. Press it again to remove the cube.""

If the player presses the button again, the cube will fade away with a pop and the random Random Red Green or Blue cubes will continue to spawn normally unless the button is pushed again.

*If button is pushed again the narrator will yell*

""Why did you press it again? I can't fix it now. Look what you've done now.""

*ACT 2 continues normally now*

If player puts the purple cube in any of the 3 slots, the counter will start to flick to random numbers and the white void you where in has now faded to a black.

""No, oh no. This isn't good at all, I better cut the simu-"" 

Narrator stops mid-sentence

""Nevermind, hey Employee #2 behind the console there should be a plug, would you pull it for me?""

*If player pulls it, all objects will disappear and you'll be left in a black void. But then the void turns back to white, and you are once again presented with the console, chute and the narrators welcome. (Plug doesn't show up untill red button is pressed.)

From then on the story will repeat, but address you as employee #003 instead of two. If you get to that point and reset the game again, it will go up a number, and so on. 

*If player doesn't pull the plug, the game will reset on its own, you'll be back in the white void with a fresh new console, but this time there is no narrator.*

-end, for now-

I know that wasn't much of a quick run down, more like 25% of the entire story. Basically you do different things for different endings, if this is added to steam each ending could be an achievement. If you lads think this is a good game idea I'll post a pastbin link with a more detailed story line including all the ending and somewhat thought of easter eggs, also this is heavily inspired by The Stanley Parable, if you didnt already notice.

Reference/Key for this mess: 

https://imgur.com/a/2PfdkFp - full album

I sent in a ticket because I ran out of options when trying to fix my base station with the blinking red light, got a swift caring response back walking me through some steps and clarifying some facts. Fast forward a few months as this sort of things stresses me, I finally get round to responding with the information required.

A few days later I'm given a tracking number and told to pack the base station and a controller (right side trackpad issue) and they'll ""take care of this"" for me. 
When there's a chance at getting money the customer service is nice and quick. [Picture 1](https://imgur.com/ORRpEqe) 

No later than the next day I've been asked to pay near £120 for the repairs, being told my base station is no longer under warranty when it is and my controller due to a scratch/white paint from my cupboard on the end of the circular sensor needing me to pay for the full body kit to be replaced. [Picture 2](https://imgur.com/99nY8oD) [Picture 3](https://imgur.com/LzGVpT1)

Wanting to take this one item at a time I ask about the base station because that was beyond confusing. I get an email completely making me relieved, right? [Picture 4](https://imgur.com/qaj7CRP)

No - I check the ticket numbers and its a conflicting statement. Ticket number ending in 82 is the controller, ending in 80 is the base station. Meaning they're repairiing the wrong device. [Picture 5](https://imgur.com/JhtBJNG) [Picture 6](https://imgur.com/g2ilDLs)

Now its near Christmas and I'm currently expecting to receive a controller in a week or so when it should be the base station as promised. I'm reaching out to them through email, trading standards &amp; twitter whilst communicating with others who have had a similar issue.

[Picture 7](https://imgur.com/gDyinmF) is just about the controller and how if I was to ask it would be rejected to waive the inspection fee and just return it to me.

Any help is appreciated!


EDIT: 09/12/2019

I'll include my email to them and the response I get from here on out, thanks @RustDragon for the fair point.

I've received [word](https://imgur.com/a/D4MVj0O) from Vive and it seems like good news regarding the base station, I'm assuming by 'fix this issue' it's an optimists dream that it's the controller they're fixing, so I'll need to work on getting it back as they've informed me they don't do partial repairs [here](https://imgur.com/a/9dueLvF)

TL;DR
HTC are refusing to give me my product that I paid for unless I give them more than half the repair fee just to receive it in the same condition as I sent it in.

My play space is literally the minimum size SteamVR will allow, however. I don’t need that much slack on the HMD side in order to move around, so it seems unlikely that I would get tangled.

Vive,Bring a real heavy bag in with Vive Pucks.,"My Family was playing BOXVR tonight (we also play thrill of the fight, with fun on the heavy bag and body dummy) and I was thinking if the **Vive puck** could be used not only to bring boxing gloves in but **what about an actual heavy bag**.

I think this could get away with just two pucks but would be further customized with four pucks (for gloves).

Thing to question first off, can a game be coded for this, it would need to be set up correctly in your space.  Pretty much specifically for the game but hey all Gym equipment, bags etc are anyhow.

• Could a heavy bag be brought in with a **Vive puck** on top and on the bottom back side with the base stations fixed to properly track and pucks secured, we know gloves can be brought in.

• Could the **coding account delivered bag weight as input options** to help with bag motion tracking?

• Could the bag while in game have a **visual overlay arcade point system** to score and maybe even rhythm (think top right and bottom right side \*Behind the bag has an affixed glow or flash indicator for a hook and circle indicators on the face of the bag for straights and jabs when called up).

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly, if this could be done it would be niche I know but **how awesome would it be to have something you could for the first time (as far as i know) actually feel a real life impact from while in VR and not a simulated impact**, really as far as I know it would be the first real world experience and actually could be done, right now!   Or does this seem far fetched?   I personally would set up a space just for this to try out myself if I could even code a game for it =\\

Vive,What has changed on the Original Vive since release?,"Another post was asking if buying a used original Vive headset was still worthwhile and a good introduction to VR. It had some good answers which helped me, but the questions I have now are a little different.

(Honestly you can probably skip the big wall of text here and just skip to the questions at the end. This is just background about why I am asking and is included to help you all provide better recommendations.)

Background: I have spent most of today watching and reading reviews on the various main brands of headsets, (Valve Index, HTC Vive, Vive Pro, Cosmos, and the Oculus Rift, Rift S, and Quest) and haven’t really gotten as close to a decision as I would have liked. At the very start, before watching any reviews, I was considering a Vive Pro because I could find “used” ones (minor cosmetic damage kind of used) for ~~~$500,~~ now seeing more like $700-$800 (I was probably remembering that price entirely wrong) but a lot of the reviews I have seen have made me realize that’s not really what I’m looking for. I don’t really want to go for an Oculus because Facebook owns them and I don’t want to support their rampant privacy invasion. That’s just a personal choice. I more recently have been considering a refurbished/used Vive from the Vive website (so technically “Certified, Pre-Owned”) which are only $400. I have played with a friend’s PlayStation VR and I enjoyed it, so I have no reason to believe I’ll hate VR entirely, but I’d rather not spend $1000 on an Index and then use it only a handful of times. I *could* afford it, but I’m just not comfortable spending that much when I don’t have much experience yet. The common opinion seems to be the Cosmos is garbage so I’m steering clear of that for now. I’m open to lesser known brands as long as the headset is still decent, but I have yet to really come across much on them other than they exist.

I intend to be using the headset with my PC (Windows), primarily for games. One I’m excited for at the moment would be Subnautica because that was a great game and will hopefully be a whole new experience in VR. I’ve got a good space that I think should well behind my desk.

A lot of the reviews on the original Vive that I have found are from 2016 and seem to be from around the time of release. Obviously things have changed since then, which brings us to...


*Question 1:*

What has changed and been fixed since release? What concerns of the reviews from release can I ignore?

*Question 2:*

Are there other headsets that you all recommend I look at?

*Question 3:*

In the aforementioned post, someone recommended the Samsung Odyssey Plus. I’ll be looking for reviews shortly but I wouldn’t mind some more input on it. Does anyone have experience with it and care to share?


And in general, any advice you can offer to help me on my search would be appreciated!

Edit for fixing some information, at to add another question:

*Question 4:*

How important is accurate tracking? What are the effects of inaccurate tracking? This keeps coming up in reviews and I realized I don’t understand yet what difference that actually makes. It’s one thing for your hand to “float away,” but is it really that bad to have it a few millimeters out of place?",1575787124.0,1,9,129422

Vive,So 1.0 hardware is compatible with Base stations 2.0 but 2.0 hardware isn't compatible with base stations 1.0? Is that correct?,"I'm a little confused. (editing for clarity because I butchered the title)

It seems that **v2 headsets and controllers** *are* compatible with **base stations 1.0**.

But **v2 basestations** are ***not*** compatible with **v1 headsets and controllers**?

Meaning, if I upgrade my base stations to v2 buy purchasing the index kit, they will **never** work with OG vive controllers, pucks, HMD etc?

Having forward compatibility but not backward compatibility seems, dumb to me. Maybe I'm reading this wrong.

Edit: ok so I'm not reading this wrong, Basically, if I upgrade to an index and EVER find myself in a situation where I want to go back to the old controllers, or maybe get a vive pro, I have to downgrade the base stations.

I noted that one application on the list has not yet been released, while another had been renamed from its earlier incarnation.  In addition, I've included Glycon Pro which is not sold through the Steam store, but instead is a utility for Motion Capture that supports the trackers.

I've recently added Sansar to my list after a fellow Redditor alerted me to its support (thank you)!  Without further adieu, my current list:

Vive,Vive Intermittent Fault - Loses Stereoscopic View,"My Vive (original) has developed a weird intermittent problem. It randomly stops displaying the image stereoscopically. Or else it suddenly decides to display completely the wrong projection for stereoscopic viewing.

It plays normally for maybe 10 or 20 minutes, then suddenly it'll decide to no longer display a stereoscopic image. Both eyes are rendered and both displays are on and working, but either both eyes are displaying the same image or the image is displayed in completely the wrong stereo projection and it becomes unviewable. If you close one eye it looks fine but not with two eyes.

If you put the headset down and let it go into standby, then pick the headset back up again the image is then fine and rendered correctly.

Does anyone have any ideas?

Thank You",1575728795.0,1,0,129422
Vive,"We released our new update ""Tesseract Abyss"" for Swords of Gargantua","Hi all,

We released new free DLC for Swords of Gargantua, called Tesseract Abyss!

It's a rogue-lite mode that can be done solo or through multiplayer. Players move downwards into the ""abyss"" fighting in different areas that are chosen from a random selection after each stage.

Along the way you'll earn power-ups, can collect weapons, craft them into stronger weapons and level up your own character's base abilities. There'll even be a shop that appears from time to time which you can buy items (like power-ups and health) through the coin you earn by winning battles.

If you die, you'll carry everything over into the next play minus your initial level. It's pretty tricky so you'll most likely die a few times. Looking forward to seeing everyone progress through it!

Please check it out and let me know what you think!

I saw a suggestion someplace saying that the bluetooth something or another might have died inside the controller, but I'm hoping that's not the case, cause one of these controllers is $120 and christmas just blew through my wallet.

I have VR myself at home, a Vive as well, and the games run through Steam VR and a few other internal systems, so I’m really hoping it has something to do with the ‘public’ software.

The games based in Unreal Engine 4, and was never designed to use a Tracker, but we do anyways. It was tacked on right before it shipped, probably because it’s a buggy mess.. One of the PCs has been coming up with ‘Fatal Error’ when trying to start the experience.

And it doesn’t happen consistently either, about 80% of the time it’ll crash, then it’ll work for no apparent reason. What’s going on?

Vive,OG Vive Motion Blur and Warping,"I have the OG Vive and this problem started suddenly about a year ago. I first noticed it in SteamVR home with the text that shows your games and other rooms you can join. If I move my head, the text will warp and trail. It is worse as I turn my head and look through the periphery of each lens. Happens equally on both sides. Once I keep my head still, it mostly goes away. Most all games are still playable, but if I stand still in a game environment and move my head around, I can see the environment warping a little bit as well. Issues I've ruled out are any headset adjustments (IPD, lens distance) and headset positioning on my face. I turned off motion smoothing and toggled a few software settings without success.

System specs are: 

OG Vive w/ original lighthouses

GTX 970 x 2 in SLI (Old I know. Tried to fix the problem by separating SLI and switching from one graphics card to the next, neither of which fixed it, so I put them back into SLI).

i7 4790K 4ghz

16gb DDR3 ram

Any ideas as to why this might be happening and is there anything else I can try? I'm hoping my lenses haven't become damaged over time, but the problem is equal in both eyes, so I suspect a software, graphics card, or headset problem. Things are still playable, but seeing the trailing and warping is very bothersome.",1575660623.0,1,2,129422
Vive,"So, what actually is the upgraded/second gen. of Vive? The Cosmos? The Pro?","So I've just been getting really interested in getting a VR headset. It's always interested me, but now I'm am feeling really close to pulling the trigger. But, when looking through the deals on Black Friday and Cyber Monday, I almost came out of it more confused. It really seems like the Rift S could be okay because I like the controllers, but the lower refresh rate, and the fact that Oculus is Zucc tech, pushed me away from it pretty quickly. The Index is still a little too high for my liking (not saying it's not worth it, just that I don't feel like splurging). WMD's are better than you expect but still have tracking issues. So, I usually end the thought process that Vive is the way to go.

But I don't really know what to get. Spec-wise, the OG Vive seems a little old for me regarding resolution specifically, but as a whole I still don't feel like it's enough. I don't know where the road goes after that, though. The Vive Pro looks pretty good spec-wise, but without having any controllers or lighthouses right now, I'd be better off getting an Index. The Cosmos looked like it might've been what I was actually wanting, but I've only heard bad things of it. In the end, I almost am where I start in the beginning because nothing feels right for me to buy. Is there anything down the pipeline that might be popping up, like more upgrades or updates?

Vive,HMD weighs more on one side? (Original Vive),"I just got a (Used) Vive today after using an Oculus for the last 1.5 years, and have been playing around for a little bit, and I have noticed the right side weighs down on my head considerably more than the left, and sits crooked on my face most of the time. I'm always grabbing the headset and readjusting it because my right eye is always off center except for the few seconds I readjust before it falls away again.

&amp;#x200B;

I've tried pulling the cables out just a bit from the headset to loosen the slack, and that did not help, and i have the vive delux strap on. I've tried looser and tighter, adjusting my ipd even to see, but nothing alleviates it.

&amp;#x200B;

It's really quite frustrating, Did I do something wrong with the strap or something?

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: Re put on the strap and am wearing the hmd much tighter and it seems to fit on nicely. It's not on painfully tight or anything, just much more than I'm used to with the oculus. So far so good now!

I am wondering.. if you top these up and then put them in a drawer for a few months, will they be drained dry?

The problem: if i plug it in/power the linkbox i get 2 sound notifications, Multimedia and VIVE Cosmos. the multimedia audio disappears after about 5 seconds, but the Vive Cosmos is still to be found under Windows settngs-&gt; Devices.

I try to connect to Viveport, and i try to connect to SteamVR, but have had no success. SteamVR has never displayed anything but ""please plug in your VR headset"" 

&amp;#x200B;

Trying different USB ports, power cycling, refreshing USB connections in steamvr, enable direct display mode, and finally Reinstalling my OS has done nothing, reinstalling steamVR, steam and viveport quite a few times, no change..

The best game I've played so far was Arizona Sunshine, and that game would barely even be noticed in the traditional gaming space. I've refunded half a dozen games already because they were just pure garbage.

Oh and then there's a few multiplayer shooter games. Competitive games are a young man's crowd.

I am so excited about this VR headset and yet I don't feel like there's much left to do with it. 

Beat Saber is fun, but I've never been big on rhythm games.

Blade &amp; Sorcery is insanely fun for a few hours, but even with all the mod support it's still basically the same thing over and over. Also I am not looking forward to explaining myself to my wife if she ever sees what I'm doing in that game.

Gorn is the same thing but now everything is made out of dildos or something. Pass.

Vive,audio distortion/weirdness on Vive Pro - USB C to 3.5mm workaround?,"hey folks, i know this has been talked about a lot, but not recently - furthermore all the threads i searched are archived so i can't bump a topic, so i'm forced to retread old ground, of sorts.

anyway i'm a teacher at a university and we purchased a Vive Pro headset which worked fine with a older desktop. then we switched to a laptop - Alienware 17"" - and now from the Vive Pro's HMD audio  i'm getting very strange digital artifacts - buzzing, chirps, etc, especially when playing audio that stops and starts. the laptop's speaker and headphone audio are totally fine. so, i did a lot of diving into reddit threads to find that there are a lot of variations on this issue, and it seems to be related to the 'Vive Pro Mutimedia device driver' (yes it's accurately misspelled) which seems to be a USB Audio device going out to the Link box. i did testing outside of VR just in a browser opening up Youtube and setting the laptop to use the Vive as the audio output, and the audio had the same glitchy behavior, so it's not just in VR that the issue happens, at least for me.

fixes i've tried:according to one account, the NVIDIA HD Audio drivers were possibly interfering. so i removed them, and just used the 'Mutimedia driver'. no change in behavior. then i reinstalled the HD Audio drivers and disabled the non-HD driver. same effect - no change. i've unplugged the link box and restarted it, and it doesn't seem to do anything either. however running a long audio cable from the headphone jack on the laptop to a set of earbuds resulted in clear, glitch-free audio, though now with two cables to deal with instead of one. one thought i did have concerning the new SteamVR audio oriented update (1.8) that just dropped, is i wonder if it actually was a step backward and is causing these issues. would love to rollback to an earlier driver to test but search results covering how to downgrade SteamVR are depressingly sparse to non-existent.

so continuing from the workaround perspective, i'm aware that you can purchase a USB C to audio adapter hooked up to the port on the HMD, but curious what's a good one? would i need one with a right angle USB connector so as to be unobtrusive? if someone could help me with some product links i'd be grateful! likewise anyone with similar issues just to get confirmation or fixes would also be appreciated. thanks in advance!",1575525219.0,1,4,129422

Vive,Crazy behavior of one of two base stations 2.0,"Hey guys, I got the Vive Pro Full Kit yesterday and everything works fine so far. However on the Power Management Tab I discovered, that one base stations has a connection failure, it works absolutely fine while playing tho. I make it short:

\- Everything is freshly updated and on the newest version

\- Power Management: One BS is working fine the other has a warning sign: ""Connection failure, click refresh to try again"", when I turn off VR, the working BS is going into sleep mode (intended) while the other obviously not.

\- Channel Configuration: The BS is discovered and working, but I cant switch channels. When I click on it it says: ""BS requires a device update to enable channel configuration.

\- In the Device Manager (Windows 10) everything looks good.

\- The other base station is working absolutetly fine altho I updated both successfully.

\- Both work fine while gaming

Vive,The Cosmos is the right idea sold the wrong way,"I've had a chance to try out the Cosmos and quickly noticed it could have filled a niche in the market, but doesn't. It's strength is versatility, as it can do pretty much anything - inside out, base stations, wireless, etc. 

I think one reason it is failing is the lack of versatility in purchasing options. They should sell the headset cheaply with no faceplate or features, and let people purchase their favorite accessories seperately. Not many people will be happy purchasing it as is, bundled with junk at a premium price. For example, right now if you wanted to use base stations, you're still stuck paying for the cost of an unused inside out faceplate which is a large extra expense. 

The wands are absolute garbage and I think many people would be happy if they could combine index knuckles while using the Cosmos headset. Again you're forced to purchase spendy HTC accessories that are best left unused. With inside out, the tracking is at best marginal. However a huge mistake was needing a total of four AA batteries to run these things for just a few hours.  USB recharging is the only solution that makes sense, and adding more disposable batteries to an already crappy design is just a big step backwards. It's possible the inside out tracking can be further improved through firmware updates, and current users should consider themselves volunteer beta testers while they try.

All that aside, the Cosmos has some great video and audio qualities and is one of the more versatile headsets as far as possible options that can be added. The flip up option is pretty neat. Because it already comes bundled with all of the low end gear, anyone wanting to add stations or wireless is going to be out a ton of money, which makes a high end set a better option instead.",1575357826.0,124,54,129422

Vive,Is using a DVI/D to VGA to the monitor downgrade the VR experience ?,"Hello guys !

Just for some context (if you like to read my bad english, if not, TL;DR at the bottom), a friend of mine recently bought the HTC Vive, and because she didn't know how to set it up, i helped her throught pains and frustrations on mic.

The thing is, i sold her my old GTX 970 MSI (for cheap don't worry) to replace her old graphics card that wouln't have run anything anymore.

But when she had to plug things, i've felt dumb to not thinking about it; the HDMI cable was already taken.

For more context, the 970 has : 1 HDMI / 1 Display Port / 1 DVI-I / 1 DVI-D

Welp i quickly told her to buy an adaptator because her monitor has only a HDMI or VGA input.

So she went out to buy a VGA/DVI adaptator and everything went fine, until she started to play it and said it was ""quite pixely"". Note; i can't try this by myself as we are living 5 hours away, and my perception would have been corrupted by the Index.

By reading a tutorial [here on steampowered.com](https://support.steampowered.com/steamvr/HTC_Vive/) i've seen; *""If you don't have any HDMI output available, you can use a DisplayPort to Mini DisplayPort.""*

**So my question is:** Is using a DVI/VGA adaptator to the monitor change/downgrade the quality of the Vive ? I hope my english is understandable.

**TL;DR:** Friend new to VR, not enough ports at the back of the graphics card, switch the HDMI to the monitor to the VIVE and using a DVI/VGA adaptator to the monitor.
Friend complained about the pixely thing. Question is; does the adaptator change/downgrade the quality of the Vive ?

Vive,HTC Vive Pro- (Review and comparison with modded lenses),"\----TL:DR- Can skip to my 2 ¢ below----

I have had the original Vive for about 3 years or so and I wanted a higher resolution headset. I have not had a reason to upgrade HMD's and was holding off. With the recent announcement of Half Life: Alyx, Metal of Honor VR, and then Boneworks coming out in a few days I had the itch to burn some more money on this niche market. Well, Vive Pro was $200 off last week and was almost the same amount as the Index, headset only. The 120-144hz refresh rate of the Index and it still being $100 cheaper than the Vive Pro's (sale price) seemed like the way to go. But I wanted to retain my Vive Wireless attachment and Index does not have a solution for this yeeeet! So I got the Pro, watch the Index get some new tech right after this review and releases wireless capabilities...

I have modded the lenses, upgraded my pc more than enough (pretty much built a new one will show some specs below), added a Vive wireless attachment, wireless ModMic, deluxe audio strap, made some custom foam inserts/pads for added comfort or support, Index controllers, special straps for my Vive wands I made, and a few other odds and ends in order to make VR more enjoyable. I find many little things that annoy me and I have to tweak them. I don't play all the time but I still have logged around 600 hours or more in VR with more than 94 game titles. I play anything from Onward (161 hours played) to Beat Saber and Skyrim VR (with plenty of mods in both) so I would say I am a pretty big enthusiast and I love VR, I don't play many 2d games anymore after I got into it.

OG Vive has to have most of these mods in order for me to play them. Overall the one mod I have to have is the lenses, I can't STAND the Vive and Vive Pro's garbage fresnel lenses at all. I have a few friends who have the same opinion but get a lot of mixed reviews online about the lens swap. After a few friends purchased a Vive, after playing mine a few times, they then asked why mine looks so much better than theirs... the solution to this blurry god ringed ""high quality"" HMD is--- $30 Samsung Gear VR Lens Swap! + adapters. They went proceeded to get new lenses ASAP after I told them.

# ---- 2 ¢: REVIEW/COMPARISON w/ mod----

So I couldn't find anything besides reviews or comparisons on the stock headsets with the OG Vive and Vive Pro so I decided I would make an ass of myself reviewing these with mods. Well many people love the Samsung Gear VR mod yet many do not. I am not sure where people get the idea that the Samsung lenses cause some issue's and they revert back to the fresnel lenses saying they distort the view or they make everything look flat. I have heard this a few times, but have also seen Reddit posts that the reviewer said they absolutely hated the lens mod, just to see an update later saying they installed the lenses backward lulz.

I can say for sure, comparing the the Vive and Vive Pro was not seeming to be worth the money right out of the box the other day. God rays annoy me, the sweet spot is tiny on the OG and Vive Pro lens. The comfort of the Vive Pro is amazing and I can see me enjoying being in VR much longer... yet something seemed wrong about this upgraded HMD. I just dropped $600 on a headset and the resolution did not seem really any better. I couldn't read writing in the Steam Menu, distant Tree's in Skyrim VR were just as blurry as the OG Vive, and I really couldn't justify the headsets price. I was very disappointed besides the better weight distribution making the headset have a much greater wearability vs the Old Vive with a deluxe audio strap.

Swapping out the lenses I couldn't help but feel like I was going to be returning this new HMD as it wasn't worth the money first go, and instead maybe I could give my mother the money to get a new set of teeth. Thank god I was wrong she can continue to starve! NIGHT AND DAY difference in clarity, the sweet spot is improved, and god rings vanish into my terrible memory where I file repressed fragments of my past. But I have already seen this before with the OG Vive w/mod. The thing I really wanted was crisper distant objects, as this was the last thing I needed for a greater immersion. I could make out far off distant objects right away. In Skyrim, Onward, Fallout, and even modded games that are not meant for VR originally... you name it I can see it. Instead of a blob of a tree 100-200 or so yards out, I could see a tree with crisp lines and it not forming into the background like a terrible painting with the colors bleeding together.  *With the stock lenses on the Pro OR on the OG Vive w/ the mod*, this was always the case, distant backgrounds form together, as if you needed glasses and were nearsighted. Up close everything looked great, far away not soo much. But the Vive Pro lets me see a farther distance hands down with the new optics. I would seriously play a OG Vive with the lens mod over the Pro with stock lenses.

I obviously have a bias towards this mod over the stock garbage that who ever came up with should be euthanized, but I also understand these lenses really help people with motion sickness.

&amp;#x200B;

**Image-** Some say you lose 3d image with this mod, maybe it is a little more flat: *8.5/10 from the stock lens 7/10  w/mod*

**Sweet Spot-** Same as the OG Vive w/mod, but you get better FOV. The 15-20% sweet spot upgrades to like 70% w/ mod: *10/10, for both OG and Pro.*

**Clarity-** Distant objects, up close, writing/text all much easier to see now Hands down a *10/10* w/mod  from a *5/10 before*! Likewise with the OG Vive w/mod, but the Pro really has a lot more details at a distance than the OG Vive w/mod. This was what I wanted as I felt immersion in a game like Skyrim is thrown off by a bleeding together background.

**Field of View-** On the OG Vive w/mod you did lose a bit of FOV (5-8%) , but not with the Vive Pro thanks to the telescoping screen! With glasses, you will lose FOV and how much depends on how far they stick out, but I press these babies right up to by corneas so my I can have my ""retinas seared like tuna steaks"": 8\*/10\* as you get a little more binocular feel but not much as you may notice on the OG vive and that the Vives just don't have the best FOV anyway.

**Screen Door-** I did notice a tiny amount but even with the stock HMD, it is much less with the new rez of the Pro! Maybe a little more noticeable with the new lenses popped in but nothing you will see without really trying to notice it. Much better than the OG Vive! Especially in low light/high contrast locations: *8/10*

**God Rays-** The awful god rays are gone, but still get a little bit of haze/fog off of low light/high contrast area's (like if you are in a dungeon or crypt in Skyrim and the candles cause a awful god ray, you get a little haze, still 100x's better than being blinded by the fresnel lenses).

**Performance-** This does not really pertain to the mod, but overall some games don't like the wireless with the higher resolution. Most dev's have done a great job and they work fine. In less optimized games you might have to kick the setting back a little as I did with games like Cosmic Sugar. Which is almost unplayable for the Vive pro? =(

**Barrel Distortion-** There is some small distortion on the edges of the new lens like the old Vives mod, but it is easily changed with swapping some lines of code out. I did not test it without the new lines of code and I am using the 2nd set of upgraded ""code"". I think they have the 3rd set out now. Either way you have to look at the edge of your lens to see this and is not noticeable unless you are picky as all hell, in that case grow up children (as I sit here and complain about all the little things I hated on my OG Vive)..... hypocrisy at its finest!

Thanks for reading! Hope my incoherent rambling, poor grammar and nonsense was somewhat helpful.

*ME*\--*""I felt like I was wasting money after getting the Wireless attachment and not seeing much for new content coming out in the land of VR, after Half Life was announced I realized that the market was soon to explode and VR would consume my life.... well hopefully after wasting another $600+ on this crap""*

Vive,GearVR lens mod - distortion tips?,"Good day,

I was able to get my hands on a 2016 GearVR for $20 and a buddy printed me the lens adapters, so I went ahead and did the lens mod.

Amazingly clear. Fantastic.

Naturally there is some distortion and I applied a bunch of the various fixes. Some worked better than others, and now I am trying to dial it in with  SteamVR-Undistort, starting with the V3 profile. 

Having some success, but I'm wondering if anyone has tips on using it more efficiently? 

As well, I've read that I should do it with the green crosshairs, but is this the crosshair with all the hash marks, or the simple crosshair that's just two intersecting lines?

Cheers.

Update:  got it all dialed in, almost completely perfect! Used V4 of the distortion fix and did a bit of additional tweaking in the Undistort tool, pretty much just around the edges. For $20 this had a major impact on my experience, I love it.

I also see why some people can't stand it, before I got it dialed in (took hours and tried every version of the fix I could find) this made me fairly dizzy and looked really distorted. It seems you need the patience and time to really fiddle with it for this to work well for some people, although my wife threw it on (before it was dialed in) and couldn't see any distortion at all.",1575321744.0,6,24,129422

Vive,VIVE official certified pre-owned nightmare.,"I've been really wanting to get VR for years now, and just this black friday weekend the vive store was selling them for $350 certified pre-owned, free shipping and everything. Great! So I ordered it, it shows up today, and I can't wait to get things set up. Once everything is set up, all I gotta do is plug in the Linkbox and the headset. So, I go to plug in USB, HDMI, and then.. the power cable was the wrong size. I go and check and my heart sinks. I got three identical power cables and they only fit the base stations. I guess the third one was supposed to be the power adapter that would've fit the Linkbox to power the headset, however, that cable is too large to plug into the Linkbox. It only fits the base stations.

Has anyone else received the wrong power adapter? HTC wasn't much help with support. They offered to have me pay to ship it back, wait a few weeks, and eventually get an answer. Or, wait a few more weeks to get the right power adapter sent to me as they were apparently short on supply.",1575330632.0,1,11,129422

I told him (by text) buy a couple Rift S's today on Cyber Monday for $700 total and go to Best buy and tell them you want a minimum of i7 7700k, GTX 1060, 8gb RAM

Also: he wants to play online games with me since he never gets to see me so I thought we could play VRChat and Pavlov

Can this* PC run both smoothly? (I sent him the link)

I spent a good 6ish hours getting project cars working decently enough, and it's pretty awesome. The rendered interiors are amazing, and the hud is pretty cool too.

Either I'm way ahead of everyone, or I get behind and it feels like there is no possible way to catch up.

Yesterday my headset crashed (black screen in headset, no longer being picked up by base stations) and SteamVR said I needed a firmware update for my headset.

Firmware update fails. Says I need to plug in my headset to the computer or try unplugging headset and plugging it back in.

Best I can tell from Steam VR Troubleshooting, and Vive and Viveport troubleshooting, you shouldn't need to plug in a wireless adapter headset to update the firmware.

I've rebooted the USB and reinstalled them, with no luck. 

My SteamVR is currently in a loop of knowing it needs to update drivers and the updates failing. 

I don't have the Pro, but I do have the wireless adapter, so I think I'm in this odd middle ground in terms of places to go for troubleshooting.

Vive,Minimizing VR UI Friction in Fast-Paced Combat,"After dealing with the UI system in Skyrim VR which pulled you out of combat every time you wanted to change attacks, I wanted to create a UI system which effectively allows for real-time combat in non-shooter games.

[My solution](https://i.imgur.com/83GKOGT.mp4) is to have four anchor-points around the screen which, when grabbed, each activate a unique spell. Similarly, different variations of any skill can be toggled by grabbing and quickly releasing any anchor point which effectively allows for real-time access to up-to eight spells. With the Index's large FOV, enough room is left that the viewing experience still feels uncluttered.

There is also an added benefit that four stationary points around the edges of your screen gives you a constant point of focus which can somewhat reduce motion sickness in some people.

Vive,How do I make Vivecraft Seated Mode feel more realistic?,"Hello, I am thinking about playing Vivecraft and I don't have alot of money, so I saw a guide that allows you to play Vivecraft with google cardboard. There is one issue, though, you can only play Vivecraft with google cardboard in Seated mode and not standing up mode. 

That kind of sucked because I don't like how the HUD is straight up over your arm and the mouse is just weird and you can't really use your headset to determine where you are looking and Standing Up mode just feels and looks better, but because of my super low budget, I might not be able to achieve that.

I did some research and found some driver application that allows people to use Wii Remotes as controllers, so maybe I could use standing up mode like that with Wii Motion Plus controllers but the application software costs quite alot, most people do not recommend using Wii Remotes as controllers and the free trial of it kind of sucks.

So I was wondering, is it possible to maybe change how Vivecraft works in Seated Mode so that whenever I move my head, the crosshair moves with the tracking of my head so that I don't have to move my mouse around to aim at where I want to break blocks? I mean, it seems kind of useless to be able to move your head around full 360 degrees, but not be able to aim where your cursor crosshair is.

I was also wondering if I could use Seated Mode whilst standing up so that I could feel more immersed by moving my head and body around whilst using some sort of joytokey software to bind controls to a controller for fun.

(I had an htc vive for 3 years and have had the index since it came out to major market). And i really think I'm missing a game that I would think is super fun. I really like plane games, because planes are just cool. And generally they are combat ones like war thunder. But I want one that has an airplane, maybe 2 seater with a pilot and a gunner in the back like early ww2 american planes. Or maybe a full bomber with like 7 people in it, but ita not just where you are controlling everything like war thunder. It should be like star trek bridge crew, where one person controls everything. And maybe if theres not enough people switching positions.you have to fight off enemy aircraft, get bombs ready to drop, drop them and fly back safely. ( game would probably last like 20 or 30 mins like the submarine game, which is good but not exacly what I am looking for). And I dont want to stop at just aircraft. So for tanks they can have a driver, gunner/loader(being a loader would be boring unless its shared with the commander, maybe there is a loader which is a commander ane has a machine gun to use for AA or for ground troops.) And a machine gunner up front too like a sherman or something. A tank game like this would be absoloutly amazing.

Vive,I’m in the market for a VR headset since Black Friday is going on. Is buying a VIVE used worth it?,"I was pretty set on buying a VIVE until I realized they aren’t restocking them. I see a lot of people on here selling their old VIVEs. I’d prefer to have original packaging in order to help my dumbass set the damn thing up, but other than that I’m fine with buying used.

Would it be more worth it to get a new Rift S instead? I’ve always thought of the Rift S as inferior to the VIVE, but I’m not quite sure how inferior it is. I’m also not interested in the Quest since it plays like shit in VRchat. I’d like my money to be worth it. Any help would be appreciated, thanks!",1575065807.0,3,14,129422

1: Turning on Steam Home

2: Turning on any game or app

3: Switching games/apps

Vive,PSA: The $5 Steam Controller can be harvested for parts to repair your Vive wands!,"I think this is fairly common knowledge, but as per subject the track pads in the Steam Controller are a 100% swap-out replacement for the track pads in the Vive wands.  As many of us have found out the hard way, those track pads will break the plastic housing and pop out (ripping the ribbon cable) with a solid crack against the wall at the wrong angle.

The only difference I've noticed in performing this operation several (4?) times now is that a) the Steam controller has only one fully smooth pad and b) the ribbon cable on the Steam controller is slightly longer than the native Vive wand cable, but still fits perfectly as a replacement.  Otherwise, the connector head, form factor, mount points and responsiveness are identical.  No glue, no nonsense.  Just swap the part and you're back in the game!

If your kids have VR Gorn parties, you will want a few of these ;)

I would always recommend pursuing warranty repairs if that is an option, but for most Vive owners, that is no longer the case.  You will of course need to watch a vid or two on carefully opening up your controllers and wands, but the operation is pretty straightforward, and doable with minimal experience if you have the right screwdriver.

With 4 boys and 2 VR rooms at my house, this has saved us a ton of money on repairs.  Highly recommended.  At $5 on sale right now, I suggest any Vive owner stock up and keep them in a closet as cheap spare parts!

Remember that each controller also comes with that magical Steam USB stick, so if you're upgrading to Index, you can use those dongles to pair your old wands as strap-on foot trackers...",1574902586.0,433,43,129422

Vive,How big of a difference will overclocking further make?,"Hey guys, I'm posting this here specifically rather than an overclocking forum because in VR we have other considerations, and a few FPS may well make a difference. I have an 8700K processor that is running at 4.8Ghz, but runs pretty hot at the moment at load, like high 80s, or low 90s, sometimes worse. I'm using the wireless adapter, and using FPS VR you can see that it does cap out my processor, not infrequently. 

So, the question for anyone who has tried is would it be worth delidding the processor, and maybe upgrading the cooler also? De-lidding would cost around $50 all told, and it looks like an upgraded cooler is more like $100. I definitely *could* spend that money, but it's not insignificant by any means. I'm guessing that doing both of these things would allow me to get up to around 5.2Ghz at slightly cooler temps than I'm at right now, as the cooler alone appears to give a 10-15c difference at load, and delidding is more like 15-20c, so that would be pretty significant together. 

How big of a difference would a 400Mhz be in terms of VR performance with the wireless adapter? If it's 1FPS, that's definitely not worth it to me. If it's 5-10FPS, it may well be.",1574981009.0,1,4,129422

Vive,My computer keeps crashing while playing VR,"So I got an RX 580 4GB refurbished graphics card from newegg back in July, and got a used Vive off craigslist in September. They've both been working perfectly for months with little to no problems arising. However, a few days ago when I was trying to play beat saber, SteamVR kept crashing and so would Steam itself. After 3 or 4 tries, I restarted my computer and tried again. It still was acting a bit weird and took a long time to load, but eventually I got it to start up. Then last night I bought some new games, the seemingly problem one being sprint vector. I had my friends try it out and when they were selecting the character it kept getting errors saying ""out of memory"", which is weird because I have 16GB of ram in my computer. After it crashed twice we went back to beat saber. After about 20 minutes of playing, it randomly crashed my whole computer. We turned it back on and now every time I try to play it, it lasts about 3 minutes before crashing. My question is, what is the problem? My first guess would be the graphics card since it was refurbished, but the low memory error I keep getting makes me think it might be the ram. Below I have the specs to my computer. (I'm kinda hoping it's the graphics card so I can upgrade to an RTX)

A lot of times when I want to quickly access my desktop from within VR I'm greeted by a full-screen game window with no way to close or minimize.

Vive,Index controllers + Pavlov VR = wow,"I just received my Index controllers.  Figured I was going to get them with Alyx, so I might as well get them now.  

So far I've only used them with the lab program as well as Pavlov VR since Pavlov is the main game that I play these days (close to 700 hours logged in it).  

It took about 30 minutes to get comfortable with the new mechanics, but once I did, holy crap.  Pavlov is really a very different game with the new controllers, and I'm guessing the same is probably true for other games as well.  

It's much better.  Way more immersive.  The main mechanic I had to learn was holding the gun.  The default position is an open hand as in normal life.  But if you do that in the game, you drop the gun (unlike with the wands where you hold onto the gun until you release them with a button click).  In order to hold onto the gun, you have to close your grip around the controller as you would close your grip around the grip of the gun.  Makes sense.  But the really cool thing is when you grip with the other hand as well.  You just grip your other controller as you would in real life.  No buttons.  It took some getting used to, but after I did, I found it much better, faster, and more intuitive.  

And then there's picking things up.  Medicine bottles, grenades.  Holstering, putting primary guns on your back.  Pavlov is a super great game, don't get me wrong, but there is quite a bit of room for improvement for interactivity.  Things are a little glitchy, but the new mechanics really got me thinking 'Man, this is incredibly realistic, more immersive, and in a way that really improves gameplay.'.  

I found that even within 30 minutes of getting used to the new controls, that I kinda had an advantage over the players who didn't have the Index controllers.  I noticed that the controllers were less in the way, and that I was more 'in the game'.  I could fire the pistols more easily and accurately, even the Barret.  But as I said, it improves the game play and the ability of the player to perform  in the game in the right way.  

Then there's flipping people off.  I'll be like 'hey, come here'  to a teammate.  I come over to him real close and then slowly and gingerly reveal my middle finger.  Its' really awesome.

Vive,Question regarding the Lighthouse Placement (Gen1),"Hey guys,

I just have a quick question regarding the placement of the lighthouses of the HTC VIVE, so the old ones, not the new ones.

I have this room ([https://imgur.com/a/SJuWX8T](https://imgur.com/a/SJuWX8T)) and want to place them bove on the wall where the dart board is placed. One in each corner. The wall is 4,10 meters wide, so they are probably about 1,90 to 2 meters apart when I put them up. Also the wall has a height of 2,60 meters and I am planning to put them up at around 2,40 meters. The direction I would mainly look while playing would be away from the wall, so facing towards the location of the picture taken.

Would this placement be possible with using the sync cable connected to both lighthouses?

Vive,Are there any good articles about the performance improvements from the HTC Vive Pro Eye?,"Its been a while since I've read anything about Foveated Rendering.   Im using a Rift so I dont always keep up with the news from the Vive side of things.  But the Vive Pro Eye was release earlier this year right?  Are there any good articles  with real world testing, about how much the foveated rendering actually reduces GPU workload?  I have seen things where Oculus stated in some of their testing, the foveated rendering allowed for a 20x savings in what needed to be rendered.  Im just curious what this looks like in the real world currently.      I want to know what peoples opinions are, that have used it.  Ive got a 980ti and a 6700k right now.  Id love to hear that with foveated rendering, that those specs would become more than enough for future High end headsets since it only renders such a small area at full resolution.

&amp;#x200B;

I know foveated rendering is still very new and still being worked on, and everything is subject to change.  Im just wanting some good stuff to read, thats not just from keynotes or development articles,  to keep me hyped for when it does go mainstream.   I just want to see how the current version has been working for people with real world examples.   Ive tried finding some stuff to read or watch, but all i can find just seems to be stuff from early this year, before the headset was launched.

When I kill some of these, they instantly come back sometimes opening something related to SteamVR, such as ""Pair a controller.""

I will say I am happy with my purchase, it takes a brain rework to ""let go"" of them after years of holding the wands constantly. It has to be said, the tracking is amazing.

Vive,Is the HTC Vive still worth it now? (Looking forwards to Half Life: Alyx),"Hey,

I was considering buying the standard HTC Vive (£500) for Half Life: Alyx. I obviously will play other VR games too.

My Dad hates the idea of buying a VR headset that has already been out for 3-4 years and is utilsing ""older tech."" Although I see his point, I don't agree with him saying I should instead buy the ""newer tech"" such as the Steam Index for basically double the price (£900).

Can you outline the advantages and disadvantages around this? I understand the Steam Index has better resolution, refresh rate, fov over the Vive - however that's obviously to be expected for a newer product. I can afford the Steam Index but it is still very expensive.

So, is the HTC Vive (The standard version for about £500) worth it as of 2019/2020?

Vive,New VR (oddly shaped) space...a bit stumped on solution,"I have an OG Vive and used it in my old home office/computer room which was a normal rectangle shape, so easy-peasy setup. A few months ago I moved and my new home office is a loft which is actually waaaay more spacious, except that the ceiling is a sharp slant downwards. One side of the room is a good 20ft tall, the other end is 4ft.

The vive trackers say a minimum height of 6.5ft above the ground is required, so I can't place a tracker at the 4ft side of the room...so my only option is to awkwardly place one in the middle of the ceiling slant and cut my play area in half.

I was really looking forward to the **Cosmos** because it seemed like a great upgrade to the Vive and with inside out tracking it would solve this issue. Unfortunately I've just not been impressed with the reviews or hardware, and unfortunately this room is pretty dark most of the day, which I hear doesn't work well for the Cosmos.

I've also heard the **Valve Index** base stations can track without a minimum height (even though they recommend 6ft - it can be used at any height, so my 4ft wall will be fine). That said, the $999 price tag on the index is just a bit steep...

I've been pretty amazed by what **Oculus** has done with the quest and quest link. Having a truly on-the-go VR headset and a PC one is something I thought was years away. That said, I'm worried about it being a visual downgrade even from the OG vive. If I am going to be spending $$ to buy something new, I'd like it to be an improved experience in some way. I'd love to hear if I'm wrong about though!

So, this is where I'm a bit stuck. I'm not sure what the best path forward is for VR right now in my space without spending a ton of money or downgrading the experience slightly. Unless the Vive trackers *will* work with one at &lt;6.5ft after all (if anyone has experience with such, please let me know!).

I 100% lurked on this community for the past two years but I will not forget everything I’ve learned. All the niche games I found out about, quality of life settings, tutorials, etc.. Thanks guys! Here’s to the future of VR!

Edit: For those of you who wanted me to give my 2 cents on the upgrade. I think that it is well worth it. One of my few complaints is that if you have a big head then the shroud that sits on your face may be a bit snug on your temples and give you a pressure headache but with precise tweaking of the knob on the back plus the strap on top you can get it feeling pretty damn comfortable.  For image quality I think that this is well worth the upgrade. You become so much more immersed in the games you are playing when you aren’t constantly distracted by the screen door effect. One last thing, setup was beautifully easy especially since I already had mounts for the base stations. The software also doesn’t make you plug in the base stations to update them which is really nice. If any of you have any tips on where I could started figuring out how to correctly tweak my settings to get the best image quality to performance ratio I would greatly appreciate it. When I first started playing around with the headset my global resolution was set to 136% (what it was set to for the Vice).

Vive,Anywhere I can try an Index in the UK?,"I've posted a couple of times on my city's subreddit, despite being a huge city (Bristol), nobody has ever responded.

I don't mind travelling a little ways to try it, plus I'll be travelling up north before and during Christmas (and back, afterwards) so I'm reasonably flexible about location.

But I've had an OG vive since release date, and while I love it, I don't use it much because it's not the most comfortable to wear and it's such a faff - I know I should get the deluxe audio strap as half my faff is with sorting headphones out, and that thing is still ridiculously expensive. With the Alyx announcement I am considering an upgrade to the Index but I just want to try it first to make sure.

I recall with the Vive they demo'd it in various places, shopping malls, and various video game shops, but the Index? I can't find a whiff of it!

So I have a weird issue now after a year of using my Vive (The exact same Issue was btw the reason i gave back my Oculus to get a vive) Also i had this Issue after 2 Months but it randomly dissappeared. So whenever i Want to play a VR Game i set up the Sensor boxes and plug in the Cable box thing and then plug in the Vive. But since 2 Weeks the LED only lights up in red. Now heres the deal: I checked the hdmi cable, used a different one, checked the Cables  and ports on the vive, checked the hdmi and usb ports on my computer and reinstalled Steam VR. Nothing helped. When I plug the vive in the light is giving me hope that i could use it, but nope. The Second i start steam VR it just changes to red telling me that i am a complete failure and dissappointment in life. Steam Vr then tells me that i am currently playing steam VR changes after 5 seconds to ""searching for your headset"" and then just goes ""steam VR couldnt detect any headset"" While this happens i hear the classic Windows ""device disconnected"" and ""device connected"" sounds multiple times... The onyl thing i could imagine is to check the USB cable. I am gonna order one now to check on later this day. But still i .. jsut feel like thats not the reason.

Does anybody know what else could be the reason and what else i could try?",1574733136.0,1,5,129422

You can even go backwards if you do the movement behind your back.

It may look silly, but personally it's been the best control scheme I've used. It gives a bit of exercise, it's easier to control where you're going and how fast you're going (your max speed is dependent on your personal speed), and it's been super-fun to use in general. Seeing all these games stick with either dashing or just a single joystick for movement feels disappointing, as there are other, more innovative and fun ways of moving about.",1574676997.0,17,33,129422

I usually wear glasses, but my glasses fit inside the Vive pretty well. Regardless, I decided to wear my contacts to play to really get that VR feel. But that's not the main problem. When I put on my headset, the only place where the views aren't blurry is when I have to push my VR up. Otherwise, the headset tends to sink down and rest right under my cheekbones. I have pretty high cheekbones, so that might be one reason, but another issue is that when the headset slides down, it also almost pulls my cheeks down and my eyelid is stretched down too. I'm not sure how I can fix this or if this should be normal. My eyes feel dry and irritated in just \~10 minutes of gameplay.

Vive,Advice on lighthouse placement with 3 base stations (part deux),"*My original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/Vive/comments/dmsxlx/advice_on_the_placement_of_20_base_stations_in_a. Making a fresh post since I ended up buying a third lighthouse and most advice was on two base stations.*

I've been playing VR for a month with temporary placements at E, on the island between G and D (where the second chair is) and at C behind the couch. So far it's going good. Sometimes I'm losing track on my left controller (facing the TV) but that might be due to the how placement of my temporary locations of the lighthouses.


B and C are not that convenient to wire power to them due to the many windows on that wall. There is a power socket at the bottom between B and C but there is no drywall to the top unless I buy a really long extension cable for the 12V. There is a small pillar as part of the frame of the window but its not ideal.

Floor plan: [top-down view of floorplan](https://i.imgur.com/bUh5zUp.png)

**Thoughts and notes on individual positions**

D has a large lamp in that corner which would occlude several angles if I mount it in the deep corner. A potential alternative is on the same wall as D but on the corner between D and F, It could potentially have a larger viewing angle. Might still need to move the lamp though.

E seems like a solid choice that covers seating VR and the majority of movements for room-scale.

**My concrete ideas on placement with 3 lighthouses:**

- **E, A, D**: With ""A"" a couple of feet to the right to be more in the center of the room covering the back of the play area. E and D cover both from the front but might be redundant. Possible occlusion by spectators in front of A.
- **E, C, D**: A variation of the previous where I swap A and C. Having C in the corner above the window prevents reflections but also is guaranteed to no not have any occlusion issues. It would also allow me to mount E deeper in the corner above the desk making it a bit less visible and makes cable management easier.

Seems like 2 pixels right beside each other .
Left one is stuck on green, right one seems to be stuck on a dark purple like color, or dark red.

Anything i can maybe do about this? Or is my hmd slowly on it's way to it's grave?

Not quite sure if they are stuck or dead.

I noticed this thanks to my vrchat friends bright orange hair.

I can't see it on black, only when there is dome color going on on those pixels, how brighter the color is supposed to be, the more it can be seen.

Was hoping to maybe squeeze a bit more life out of this hmd while saving up for either a Vive Pro HMD or Valve Index HMD. (Buying the Valve Index Controllers for sure, soon.)",1574533091.0,1,2,129422

I have a few friends who now seem interested in VR and none of them are considering the Cosmos due to its horrific reviews and price or the Vive Pro due to expensive price. 

So it feels like the only true option in the market is the Oculus Riff S, Quest, or Index - and given the price of the Index, I would imagine most people would are going to purchase and  Oculus. 

I think HTC is leaving a lot of money on the table in the VR mid tier market. It’s the perfect starter build for people who eventually want to build up to a Valve Index and they could be cashing in on the excitement.

My main priority is to play some games like Beat saber/vr chat/some simulators but would be nice if I would be able to run something that will allow me to headpat anime girls/slime rancher/minecraft or maybe other more demanding games like nostos/fallout4 (if these will work on basic vive, not sure if googles make impact on preformance).

Vive,Temporary lighthouse mounting fixtures?,"Hi.

I've just moved in to a new flat (apartment) and it's substantially nicer than our old one where I could just about get away with having black wires running up the walls. My SO is (understandably) keen that we keep it looking pretty fancy, too, and all the walls are white. So basically I think this means I'm going to struggle to 'integrate' my Vive's lighthouses (mk.1) with this new place's decor.

As such, I'm trying to find a temporary method of having lighthouses in the living room space, but these also can't take up much floor space because there's, well, not much floor space to take up. **I've seen the tripod stands** that people use but those would take up so much floor space that my play space would be tiny, I think. 

My ideal solution would be something like a picture frame but with a tripod mount instead of a picture and subtle hooks on the walls to hang the frames on, but I wonder if there's another solution with repeatable 'zeroing' - maybe something with magnets? - so that I don't necessarily have to redo the SteamVR room setup every time I want to play.

Also, I know you're supposed to not have any reflective surfaces in your space but I'm just not going to take our art down every time I want to play something - is there a solution to that other than taking down the art every time I want to play something, or maybe some tricks with regards to positioning the lighthouses so that this matters less?

Vive,Left eye showing up in right lens,"Hi,
For a while now, I've been having trouble with my Vive. On more intensive games, such as Skyrim VR and VRChat (thanks to custom avatars), I've been getting times where my left eye's display will be shown in my right eye. I've tried all of the following in order to fix it:

-Replaced the cables between the link box and the HMD twice

-Replaced the HDMI cable between the link box and my GPU

-Directly connected my HMD to my computer without the link box

Has anyone else gotten this error? I've noticed that it only really happens on intensive games where reprojection is high. I'm going to try to fiddle with some settings and see if that fixes it, but in the event that that doesn't work, does anyone have any suggestions? It's gotten to the point where some games are unplayable due to me having to keep my right eye closed to avoid motion sickness/dizziness/disorientation.

Disconnecting and reconnecting the HDMI cable on the link box seems to fix it, but only for a short while.",1574391142.0,0,1,129422

This seems like a big deal to me and got me thinking about the handful of local asynchronous co-op titles in the VR world like [Late for Work](https://store.steampowered.com/app/623540/Late_For_Work/) and [Eye in the Sky](https://store.steampowered.com/app/566700/Eye_in_the_Sky/). Has anyone tried this feature out with these games or others like them? I wonder how well it works because I feel like this has the potential to be a big deal for VR and VR adoption. Similarly to how [VRChat](https://store.steampowered.com/app/438100/VRChat/) has gotten so many people interested in the tech by playing with people in VR and sharing in their experience, this seems like it might add that same value to those games that have chosen to focus on the local multiplayer party-style experiences.

And another question - I wear glasses, do have minus 3 vision it's called here, not sure of the measurement system in your country my dude. So is it possible to wear glasses and the vr helmet, or you can customise the lenses in the helmet so you'll have 100% vision. Hopefully it is so.

It is more severe when I look around. There is no improvement standing a foot from (either) sensor in the corner of the room. If the system isn't grey screening, then the perspective drifts.

Note that, although my initial setup reads as correctly aligned (the red cone almost parallel to the green cone in the attached) that is no longer the case, as it suddenly shifts. This is approximately 30 degrees off of true measurement. The sensors are also at the corners of the play space.

I've also tested each base station individually by placing it in A mode. The drifting is only present on the red one, but both have issues with grey screening.

Anyhow, I've always been an Intel guy, but I don't care about the wireless adapter. Just thinking about my budget and wanting to not go crazy with it.

Any recommendations for a new rig? I don't want to go over... say... $350? If I can help it. I'm thinking maybe $120 for a mobo, $150 for a CPU, $80 for RAM.

Vive,Could HL:Alyx be the first true Index controller specific showcase game?,"Unlike Oculus with the Touch controllers Valve didn't drop any full-sized launch titles that either required Index controllers or had real consequence in using Index controllers.

Imagine a point in the game where you you need to maintain a specific squeeze pressure, not too much, not too little. That would be less fun to pull off with analog grips/triggers on Oculus Touch controllers and no fun at all to pull off with the analog pad on a Vive Wand. Folks asked to play Aperture hand lab with Touch controllers so they did it - but it's not at all a equal experience.

&amp;#x200B;

If Valve doesn't create an AA+ game that makes owning an Index controller worth the cost in a truly demonstrable and ""game changing"" way that eclipses Touch - who will?

Vive,Vive Wireless Quick Tips,"Been using Wireless for about 600 hours now, here's some tips:

\- Be super careful when you rest your headset backwards you don't bend your power or Vive Pro AIO cable! For whatever reason they though it was a good idea to use long straight cables, which you can easily push against and potentially damage.

\- The USB Power cable get hot! The USB A-A cable provided is absolute garbage and broke within a week for me, but yourself a thick A-A cable and be aware if it gets too hot it can cause your headset to disconnect.  I personally recommend buying a right angle USB cable.

\- 3rd party batteries are generally pretty decent, most 10k Mah batteries tend to get unreliable once they hit 25% - Either get two 10k batteries or one 20k. I personally run one 20k Mah battery taped to my headset which lasts around 8-9 hours.

\- You need a good processor to run Wireless, it tanks CPU usage. Running Vive Pro on an 8 core 5Ghz idles VR around 34%! Ensure you're running either an overclocked quad core or 6 core processor to avoid issues.

\- Wireless does overheat, I'm in Australia and it get quite hot. I would just recommend either using AC, or cooling it with a mini fan when it gets hot. This doesn't apply as much to standard vive as it outputs less heat.",1574140859.0,6,1,129422

While Steam may have a lot more VR games overall, they're often MUCH smaller and have MUCH smaller budgets. Sure, I could just use ReVive, but it's not always a perfect match.

Vive,"Today is the last day to use GonzoVR, ever","After a little over a year on Steam, we're shutting down GonzoVR for good later today.

We had a blast talking to the people who checked it out, and I genuinely have friends that I met in GonzoVR that I'm closer to than my meatspace-friends.

It's certainly true that our user numbers were never very large, but in the end that wasn't the main issue. We always felt that the first priority was to create something that people really sustainably enjoyed, and once we had that we would then focus on getting more broadcasters and users. The big problem was that the kind of experience that everyone enjoyed the most: small broadcasts with 3-6 people, could never be economically valid for a broadcaster. We tried a few things to foster larger groups while still giving everyone a chance to talk, but there is only so much speaking time to be distributed. As soon as someone felt that they weren't contributing, they would leave.

We're making a new application now that builds off of what we've learned that people want, and the kinds of social groups that lead to the most enjoyable experiences.

Anyway, as a final note, I just want to say thank you to everyone who took the time to try GonzoVR out, and leave a review. People saying nice things about our work was what kept us going for as long as we did.",1574028486.0,77,12,129422

Vive,Got GTA 5 VR working without VorpX. Veryjos injection / grandtheftvr.com mod gameplay. Can it get finished?,"I am getting into the veryjos GTA 5 Open VR that came out in 2015 or so and I have to say just as an injection into the Vive headset is perfect. Comparing this with the VorpX injection, i'm blown away on this one just on it's out of the box nature to work well and not make me sick. It's unfortunate that it only gives you a set of guns, and a taster of the game (although the experience is still really good) because I want to play the whole game in VR. This mod is  geared towards usb racing wheel users, which is why I assume it was set up to be used with only one controller. What happened to this mod's progress? SOMEONE GET THIS GUY A JOB AT Rockstar. The story campaign would be playable (despite weird glitchy cut scene stuff) and also the game in general if both controllers were put to use. With one controller I have trouble aiming and continuing on a straight path. It feels weird compared to set ups like onward.  


Also, the [Grandtheftvr.com](https://Grandtheftvr.com) mod works without Vorpx using this Veryjos OpenVR alpha, my only gripe with that is that you can't shoot out of the car like in the veryjos version. Also my previous experience with this mod was using Vorpx, and it was severely sickening and low frames per second. Playing the [grandtheftvr.com](https://grandtheftvr.com) mod with the Veryjos injection is much much more playable, like native VR. I also like how the control scheme is set up, even if I have to use VoiceAttack to jump into and out of cars. I'm still working on my voice attack bindings, and i'm hoping to bind a lot of the switching character stuff, the thing about voice attack is figuring out how long each button needs to be pressed so it's been not working perfectly. That's my fault though, as i said.  


What's weird is that after launching the grandtheftvr mod with the numpad, I decided to hit L and launch the Veryjos mod, and to my surprise I had a gun in each hand and could shoot both of them. Only when I moved away I noticed that veryjos mod gun was dragging behind and pointing towards me instead of where the controller was pointing. It's totally unplayable like this just to mention.  


I was going to buy myself a usb racing wheel so that I could hopefully get that working with the grandtheftvr mod (with more mods). I know it works in the veryjos mod and i'll give that a go as well, but i'm looking to do the campaign. I think if shooting a gun out of your car was added to the grandtheftvr mod then it would be totally playable with voice attack no problem because it runs great and the VR view just gives you a weird perspective during cut scenes. and you can't see the map unless you system button out to desktop view. but yeah no gun in car and you can't shoot the folks during the boat highway chase, ect.   


Is it me or can you not shoot the gun out of the car in the grandtheftvr mod? Maybe since i'm not using vorpx i'm missing a function? idk. You decide. Let know in the comments below. It would be nice if someone could fix these two mods up into a working mod, possible?",1573973008.0,50,18,129422

I tried switching the only functioning bluetooth dongle with a nonworking one on its (the one vive gives) hub thing.

This is very weird and frustrating to me, because when i connected the dongles directly through usb without the hubs, it shows in the ""bluetooth and other devices"" that i have 3 connected ""Watchman dongle"" so clearly they work?

So then why do the trackers not connect to them no matter what i do and how much i pair, and only stay with the blue light on?

Got the  first htc vive with no deluxe audio and with the vive ugly wands.

Sadly....valve dont want my money so i cant buy a index in canada...but is the vive comos worth it? got a lot of comments about the rift or the quest as a better choice.

Vive,"So, is Vive lip tracker going to be a thing?","I recently started using the Vive Pro Eye in Neos for eye-tracking and the hardware for it is amazingly accurate. It tracks the eyelid, eye, and pupil movements. I'd love to see something for the rest of the face. 

Today, I noticed in the software about section for the tracking something interesting. There is a mention of a lip camera version. I was thinking maybe we could see this as an addon in the near future.

These items are permanent,  and are used to power up your character in many ways. For example  between sessions you can combine weapons to create stronger versions.  You can also use coins to buy health power ups.

Your  level will reset after each play but items and weapons will carry over.  You can carry up to four items / weapons into battle. Below is a link  to the full press release and screenshots. Do let me know what you  think!

Vive,Dement Demo Now Available,"Hello everyone!

We are pleased to announce the demo for Dement is now available. 

[https://store.steampowered.com/app/1022990/Dement/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1022990/Dement/)

&amp;#x200B;

What is Dement?

Dement is an open world survival horror game that has been in development for three years, and is available in early access now. Currently, the game has four of eight chapters, with most of the open world available. Throughout the early access period, we intend to pepper in new areas, weapons, and side quests while we continue to toil on getting the last four chapters done- and of course, fix any and all reported bugs. Purchase now and you will get access to ALL Dement content in the future, and be able to participate in the early access period. Suggestions are welcome; some have been made and already implemented!

&amp;#x200B;

Who is Paracytik Entertainment?

Paracytik Entertainment consists of mainly two people; one coder/designer and one writer. We hope to one day grow into something bigger, and to bring rich, fulfilling experiences to players everywhere. We want to be a part of a better gaming industry- one that focuses on games as art, moving stories, and engaging gameplay.

&amp;#x200B;

What can I expect from the demo?

The demo skips the prologue, and is the first three quarters or so of the first chapter on a 45 minute timer. The main menu, tutorial, and loading screens do not count towards the 45 minutes. If you die, half of the time since your last save will be returned to you. The first melee and ranged weapon will be provided immediately to speed up initial play. Expect to spend at least an hour playing this demo! If you get to ""The End of the Road"", tweet us a screenshot @paracytik for a congratulatory shout out! Good luck ;)

The headset/controllers are already used so I don't mind buying pre-owned base stations. I found plenty of listings online for single base stations (eBay, Vive store, Amazon, etc) but nothing for 2 base stations.

I just ordered a cosmos online, however I wasn’t privy to all this backlash circulating online regarding controller tracking, lowlight sensitivity. 

To anyone who owns this product, how are you liking it? Is it plagued with problems as described by some tech reviewers on YouTube? Or is this just a common hallmark of inside out tracking? I’m curious if people using the riftS or quest have similar issues regarding the controller tracking. 

Kinda wondering if I made a mistake , on paper the device sounded amazing. Either way I have a 90day return period if it doesn’t meet my quality standards. 

I am upgrading from the Rift CV1, so I’m hoping to see a massive improvement *fingers crossed*

I am super excited at the prospect of getting rid of the Fresnel lenses as they are the main source of my complaints with VR as a whole. Note that I can't afford to just upgrade to a better system as of yet, so that's not really an option.

I am looking at all the details involved and everything seems easy enough, but I have a couple questions about the 3D printed adapter that will be needed.

1: Is this still the best option for Gear VR (2016) to OG Vive adapter? :  [https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2837804](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2837804) 

2: If it is, which version would I be better off trying out, the fixed v3.3 or the adjustable v2.2 one?

Notes for 2: I do always use glasses with vive (as does my wife), but I don't know if it is necessary or even advised to go with the adjustable version. From the description, it appears that the maker still prefers the fixed version. I already feel like there's little to no room in the headset with my glasses and am hesitant to add anything extra in there.

3: Does the adjustable version need to be changed for each user, or is that a flat fix for the lens itself?

&amp;#x200B;

If anyone who has modded theirs and uses glasses can chime in, I would really appreciate a first hand accounting in regards to how the mod plays with glasses. Bonus points for anyone who shares the system with others with/without glasses to figure out how much of a pain changing settings are between users.

For those of you that own the regular Vive Pro or the Pro Eye version of the headset, I would like your opinions on a few things. Reviews aside, I'd really like to hear from typical users.

In your opinion, are the Pro Headsets worth an upgrade from the OG HTC Vive headset? (I'll either sell it to a friend or keep it for multiple users)

How's the audio quality of the speakers that come with the Vive Pro headsets? (I have the deluxe audio strap for my current Vive and the audio is pretty good on those) 

If you also use the Vive wireless adapter, were there any increase in latency or drops in performance?

Would 4 vive cosmos's work in this space? The issue then is I was planning to have a gun with vive tracker so then I am back to the original issue of tracking that, unless the cosmos can track vive trackers. I am also worried about how good the tracking would be with the Cosmos as well.

It was heaps cheaper than most of the others and it works really well. I need to train up a bit of muscle memory to get my left hand controller back to the right spot after changing mags but I could see I was getting better the more I did it.

Took 6 days to go from order to the UK and delivery to Australia and I've been poppin' sosigs ever since. :)

Vive,GrowRilla’s Next Content Update And Our First Reverse Sale," Hello everyone,

Salmi Games here. At the moment we are preparing for our next content update for our game [GrowRilla](https://store.steampowered.com/app/981880/GrowRilla_VR/). We don’t want to spoil anything just yet, but we have a [sneak peek](https://imgur.com/a/ZrJWkoM) of what you can expect.

With this update, we will raise the price of the game for the first time since we launched in Early Access a few months back. We’ve come to this decision after a lot of back and forth discussion internally, but in the end we feel $15/15€ price point more fairly reflects the value of our game than its original $10/10€.

The other thing we’ve tried to do (ever since our first VR game Late For Work) is to reward players who believed in us and took a chance on our games early in the process. If you supported us early, then you’ve gotten our games at their cheapest possible price. Thank you for your support! We appreciate everyone who’s tried one of our games, left a review or given us feedback.

So if you always wanted to buy the game (which you definitely did right) you can grab it now for $10/10€ or wait a week to get it for 15€! Think of it as a reverse sale.

Did we catch your attention even though you’ve never heard of our game before? You can find out more about our game [here](http://growrillagame.com/).

Thanks for reading. We are happy to answer any questions you may have in the comments.

Cheers,

Vive,Hope you redeemed your code more than a week ago if you pre-ordered the Vive Cosmos.,"I redeemed mine last Friday because I had accidentally paid for a month, and it only gave me 6 Months of Viveport. Here is the customer service response:

    Hi &lt;sirkha&gt;, 
    
    Thank you so much for the prompt reply. My name is Maria and it'll be my pleasure to follow up on your case.
    
    I can imagine this situation can be quite frustrating for you since you were not able to unlock the 12 months VIVEPORT subscription available for the VIVE Cosmos pre-ordered but let me explain to you a bit clearer the previous information. 
    
    I'd like you to think about the redeemable code as a key, a key you have to open a new code with specific features. According to your gift card, I can see you have the key available to use it until 12/21/2021, however, the subscription you unlock will depend on the current promotion you can see in our web page. 
    
    Since the 12 months code was available until 11/05/2019, all the codes redeemed after that date will unlock the present-date promotion, which at this time, is 6 months of VIVEPORT infinity. 
    
    I hope you've useful and clear this information and I'm sorry for the inconvenience. Nevertheless, if you need further assistance or if you have any questions or doubts, please don't hesitate in contacting us again, we will be here ready to help you with everything you might need. 
    
    Enjoy your coming week. 
    Sincerely,
    Maria

So does that mean you can subscribe for $5 a month and cancel anytime, or that its a year subscription, but the cost is $60 instead of $108?

Vive,Advanced Settings 4.0.0 we are in motion again.,"It's been a bit!
 
 
### **Due to safety concerns with how old OVRAS builds don't respond to SteamVR's new chaperone limits we can only recommend Version 4.0.0 at this point.**
This bears repeating. You could have chaperone misalignment with OVRAS 3.2.0 and older on the current SteamVR version. This majorly effects you if you like using our app for space-drag or especially re-directed walking.
Also, Valve changed some API keys, and now old versions will spam errors. This affects everyone.
 
**So now time for the good stuff?**
 
### What is this/Why do I care?
 Advanced Settings is an open-source free Dashboard overlay that is designed to give you access to many useful features.....
PTT, disabling chaperone, ""playspace mover"", ""floor fix"" among many many many many other features... see us on github at [OVRAS](https://github.com/OpenVR-Advanced-Settings/OpenVR-AdvancedSettings)
We try to develop and implement features that the wider vr community wants, (and is within reason XD)  hows our driv..... errr progress?
 
### HELP I HAVE ISSUES! or I just want to chat and ask questions.
 
We have a Discord at [https://discord.gg/vgvSkSk](https://discord.gg/vgvSkSk), can report issues there or help other people with issues
You can also post the issue directly on the Github @ [https://github.com/OpenVR-Advanced-Settings/OpenVR-AdvancedSettings](https://github.com/OpenVR-Advanced-Settings/OpenVR-AdvancedSettings)
As always you can leave your issues here I promise I look at them all.
 
### How Can I help!
 
Vr-er? - come join discord, report issues, test pre-releases, join the ritual to summon valve's flagship vr games!
Developer - come talk to us, do you want to add something.... assuming its within reasonable scope we probably would love to have it in!
Developer with lotsa free time - are you sure you don't want to re-vitalize input emulator it can do things we can't!
But Really what angle? honestly there is none, we love VR just like you all, and like providing the tool. If you really want to leave a donation you can donate to us individually [Kung's Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/join/kungvr), [Ykeara's Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/ykeara)
 
## Highlights of the update:
 
Motion should be fixed for all headsets!
Binding button to take you straight to the binding page
Color Control via gain. (index/vive/vive/pro) (this should have little to no performance penalty unllike overlay method)
offset profiles
pretty icons!
various optimizations.
 
Why 4.0.0 and not 3.3.0? - 4.0.0 is a breaking change, and as such certain old compatibilities will break specifically your old SuperSampling profiles, among some other items. **your keybinds will not be affected**
 
## [Download](https://github.com/OpenVR-Advanced-Settings/OpenVR-AdvancedSettings/releases)

Vive,Best Value Valve index combination?,"Hi,

I’m looking to buy a VR headset and I’m getting one later this year (Oculus Quest). I’m currently 13 years old and I’m gonna be getting a part time job in December (possibly earlier) next year at an IGA, which pays ~$10 AUD an hour, or at a McDonald’s, which from what I know pays ~$15 AUD an hour. All depending on which I may get hired for, if any. Since they aren’t the highest paying jobs, and that I’m also looking to build a PC around the same time, I’m wondering which combination of the valve index will be good for me. On the steam website, there are several different configurations. (Index, Controllers &amp; Lighthouses, Valve index and controllers only, Headset only, controllers only, lighthouses.)

I’m wondering, since the controllers and lighthouses work with the Vive, what configuration of it would be cheaper. 

Thanks!",1573469267.0,8,8,129422

Vive,Lag with hands extended out.,"Ok so this is an odd problem that i have had on and off for a LONG LONG TIME, but seems to have gotten worse recently.  


I just got the knuckles and they seem to be working great but this problem keeps coming up. Ill be playing just about any game, blade and sorcery, pavlov, or anything else standing. About 5 or 10 minutes into playing i will get a huge and i mean MASSIVE spike in lag. Unplayable. If i move my hands down to about my waist line the lag completely goes away.   


This is also accompanied by the steam menu acting oddly, by that i mean my right eye will blink on and off continuously as the whole menu is lagging severely.   


This is incredibly disorienting and ruins my experience quite quickly.   


Also it should be noted that when i play seated games like VTOL VR, i have no issue with this problem. It never surfaces.

Vive,Unpopular Opinion: I don't get the hype around Boneworks,"I am a fan of Stress Level Zero and I want to be hyped about this game. However, I am really confused on why everyone is so excited. I appreciate the amount of work that goes into creating proper physics in VR, but what about this game is more fun than the other VR games out there?

* The story seems like an afterthought, or at the very least we don't know enough to be hyped about it.
* Aside from destructible pieces of the environment, the combat doesn't look that different from other VR shooters out there.

For me a final game is about creating an cohesive experience for the end user, and from what I have seen it looks like they created an excellent physics engine for a game and then tacked on a game.

I want to be wrong, and I want to be excited. So r/Vive, change my mind...

**Edit:**

Based on the comments I now know the points below. It won't personally be a day 1 purchase for me, but I better understand why some people are excited.

\- This is exciting for people with knuckles controllers, so they can finally use them to their potential.  
\- There is still a lack of high quality VR games. So having a game with at least good physics is a step forward, and will encourage other devs to create these types of games.  
\- It will also have puzzles that use the physics.   
\- Combat options are more varied than I have seen... Though I still need to see what kind of crazy stuff I will be able to do.",1573251997.0,11,30,129422

Some players loved them and others just wanted to just keep busting ghosts. We decided to make this a separate optional challenge using a new system we're calling Relic Challenges. We just added it in the latest update which includes slightly re-balanced levels and additional types of these optional challenges to give players more variety in gameplay.

Vive,How The Scoring System Works In Pistol Whip,"When I first tried Pistol Whip at OC6, I was instantly addicted.

## Awesome Guns? Check. Great Rhythm Game mechanics? Check. Superpowers to dodge bullets and take on 100 people in 5 minutes? Check.

## All this wrapped into one epically stylized package that makes you feel badass like you’re John Wick when you play it? Check, check, check

The thing that stood out after playing it (for far too many hours the past couple weeks) was just how many layers of depth there is in it.

When you start out, you’re just learning how to shoot and dodge (basically trying to stay alive while you lament over how sore your legs are from doing so many squats dodging bullets), a little later, you learn how to shoot everything in time to the music and realize how great the flow is in the game, then finally, you learn the details of how scoring works and just go into this flow state each time you return to the game, partly making up your own rhythm each time you play.

Anyway, let’s jump right into how **scoring works** since the tutorial doesn’t cover some of these details.

The game initially ships with 30 leaderboards (10 maps with 3 difficulty leaderboards each).

## 1. Shooting

The aim of the game is accuracy and rhythm (besides Pistol Whips obviously, we’ll get to that). You can get up to 200 points per shot if it’s both:

1. **On beat to the song** (this gives 100 points)
2. **Accurate** (has to hit the enemy anywhere on their body, giving another 100 points)

**a. Accuracy**

By default, there is an “aim assist” activated. Turn this off and you’ll realize just how bad of a shot you are. Even though you may kill enemies if you have bad aim with aim assist on and get *some* points, you’ll still only get full points if your aim was close enough to still hit them.

With a maximum of 100 points, the scoring with aim assist on is calculated by “how much aim assist was needed to help you still hit your target?” This means that you can still kill an enemy with a poor shot (with aim assist’s help) and only get a couple points for your accuracy score.

**b. Timing**

Like most rhythm games, timing is extremely important, giving you half of the possible points from a shot. Unlike other rhythm games like Audica that shows exactly where to shoot and when though, you as the player are responsible for who / where to shoot and when.

When you first start playing, if your gun bullets were a percussion instrument, you’d probably get kicked out of the band. Later, you start to wonder why every band doesn’t have a “pistol player.”

**c. Additional info related to timing**

I had to ask the developers for some of these details. Timing is 150ms for each eighth note — 75ms on either side of the beat. The game lets you follow the beat with a shot within an 8th note, regardless of whether it was technically within the on-beat window. This allows for syncopation and 16th notes and allows you to still get creative with making rhythms with your shots.

## 2. Pistol Whips

Pistol Whips are very satisfying to pull off, but can be challenging at the beginning. For those who don’t know, a pistol whip is when you bash an enemy with your gun (think doing a melee hit in Halo)

To pull off a pistol whip, you have to taunt an enemy in front of you to shoot at you, dodge it, then you’ll need to time how long you have before the enemy reloads and tries to shoot you again, taking him out before he does with a swift hit to the face with your gun.

Killing with a Pistol Whip has a velocity counter, so you get max points for a 4m/s floating average. If your swing has less speed, you’ll earn less points, exponentially. Basically, pretend like the enemy is a Beat Saber block and you’ll be good.

**Why exactly would you want to do a pistol whip, it sounds riskier?** It is in some ways, but it has a payoff. Basically, a pistol whip is one of the easiest ways to guarantee maximum points from killing an enemy. Most likely, if you pistol whip a 4-shot-to-kill enemy with a bit of force, you’ll get 800 points (almost guaranteed, as long as you didn’t shoot them yet). If you shoot a 4 hit enemy twice before doing a pistol whip, you’ll only be able to get the leftover full 400 points with the pistol whip.

One last benefit of a pistol whip is that it reloads your gun and restores your full health. You don’t get additional points (beyond what you’d get if you had perfect shots), but the number of pistol whips you did in a level is also recorded for bragging rights at the end of a song.

## 3. Enemy Types

There’s 3 types of enemies in Pistol Whip.

**1 shot to kill baddies** – These give a maximum of 200 points

**2 shots to kill baddies** – These give a maximum of 400 points

**4 shots to kill baddies** – These give up to 800 points (either with a single pistol whip or 4 shots that all hit their target)

## 4. Modifiers

Modifiers are great ways to change up your gameplay and can allow you to get even higher scores if you disable aim assistant (and also have great aim). You can open up the modifier menu to see more about each one of these and how they affect your score. I’ll try to add some more details on that soon here.

So that pretty much sums up the scoring!

A few last FAQ:

## Are there mods and custom maps?

Not yet, but the devs have a lot of ideas for this and said they’ll make an announcement in a couple weeks at what that could possibly look like. A Beat Saber modeler Sir Raynor helped me mod in a new gun and got their full blessing to do so. New songs are entirely possible, but are a little complicated since there’s a whole level custom created around the song. I could still see a few ways this could work well and I’m excited to hear what the devs announce about it in a couple weeks.

Anyway, hope this was helpful. See you on the leaderboards!

Vive,"Vive HMD not displaying anything, SteamVR losing base stations, help please.","Here's what's happening, also, it's normal for the in game HMD position to be that low, since the base stations are moved from where they usually are. Also I'm aware that it's saying base station drivers are out of date, that's because I flashed it to factory drivers while troubleshooting, that's what those 3 things on the desktop are. Also, I only have one base station plugged in in the recording, because it wouldn't have mattered, the same thing happens at the exact same time as the other one: https://streamable.com/kt323

Things I have done during troubleshooting:

* Disconnected then reconnected

* uninstalled/reinstalled USB drivers

* Completely unplugged everything, including from the link box, then uninstalled and reinstalled USB drivers again.

* swapping out the HDMI cable from the link box

* Running Steam and SteamVR as admin

* power cycling the link box

* I tried directly connecting base stations via USB to check for firmware

* Testing it on my spare laptop that has never had steamVR ever installed on it before to see if it was a driver issue on my PC (Same problem on spare laptop)

* Making sure the things were plugged in on both ends

* Restarted PC after USB driver reinstall, several times

* Reinstalling SteamVR

* Switching to SteamVR Beta (and back again after that didn't work)

* Verifying integrity of the tool cache

* Power cycling base stations

* Directly connecting the HDMI to my PC

* Switching to Direct Mode

* Turning off vive camera

* Turning off Bluetooth

* Closing discord

* Uninstalling OpenVR advanced settings

* Deleting steamVR stuff from appdata for a truly fresh reinstall

* Buying an entirely new 3 in 1 cable after troubleshooting it and not getting any display from the old one's HDMI after plugging my spare laptop into a TV (still same problem)

* Connecting my vive directly to the back of my PC with the HDMI and USB on it sans the power connected to the linkbox which is *required* for power supplying

* Swearing a lot in frustration

What perplexes me is that my HMD is tracking for a set amount of time, but no in headset display is happening. The light on my Vive HMD is green till I turn on SteamVR then it's red. My base station top light remains green even after the crash, which means I can't troubleshoot if it's a base station problem since I literally went as far as to flash the firmware back to factory defaults in case there was a corruption happening and that still didn't fix it. What perplexes me even more is that the same exact problem happened on my spare VR ready laptop despite never plugging my headset into it before ever before now, which means it shouldn't be a driver corruption issue on my desktop I don't think. 

Another thing is that even though my controllers that are wireless, they get straight up disconnected in the short period it takes for the SteamVR viewport to cut out. Based on the desktop viewport of SteamVR they tracked just fine before getting kicked out of the system too; The lights on them go from green to blue in about the same time it takes for steamVR to soft crash, and they get disconnected permanently from this. Happened on both my valve index controllers *and* my vive wands.

Chatting to customer service is like non existent and they keep replying "" we are waiting for confirmation from warehouse"". Anyone returned their cosmos ? If so how long did it take to be refunded.

BEWARE: i will stay well clear of that headset . Not only is the product poor, but the customer service is atrocious to say the least. Never again would i buy anything from HTC

EDIT : So 5+  weeks later still waiting and not a single word from customer service. This to me is pure theft as I have returned their product. Next for me is legal action this has to stop and cant keep going like this . if i was the exception then cool .

Vive,Anyone know where to get thin face gaskets?,"Hello fellow Vivers,

I have a Vive Pro and although I swapped out the face gasket for a comfortable PU pleather gasket, I'm interested in getting the best FOV as possible by getting my eyes nice and close to the lenses. I've found that I can crank the tightness right up to get it fairly snug without any headaches but I feel that if the face gasket were thinner yet, I'd be able to crank out a few more degrees FOV.

Can anyone make some recommendations for really skinny gaskets? TIA.",1573131219.0,27,12,129422

Vive,Short Extension - Vive,"Hi Folks,

Currently have my computer in my computer room with my Vive in my VR room with a pass through on the wall to connect my headset. The cords have always been long enough and I’ve had no issues. Recently I’ve moved my computer to the opposite end of my desk and now the HDMI and the USB are about 3 ft too short to reach my computer. What’s the best solution to extending these cables? I’ve read people are using powered cables but that’s usually for much longer extensions ? (25ft extra)  Can I get away with just a regular extender for these cords?",1573190406.0,1,2,129422

Vive,HTC Cosmos: Lighthouse tracking of controllers?,"I have a Vive Cosmos and a Vive (original). Cosmos quality is excellent. Headset tracking is really really good, far better than Windows inside-out tracking - probably due to more cameras.  However, CONTROLLERS are lost on the games that matter (Beat Saber, RecRoom, even SongBeater). It's frustrating to know you hit a block/sphere or tossed a grenade perfectly, per the original, except for Cosmos losing it unless you are inside 50 degrees of center visual.

I know that, in February, the Cosmos will have an additional $200ish add-on for sale that allows the HEADSET to be seen by the Lighthouses, but the REAL need is for the controllers to be seen by lighthouses.

Q: Are there ANY plans, or even hacks, to improve the controllers, even by lighthouse?",1573153022.0,6,23,129422
Vive,Vive Pro wireless - wired; daily conversion solution,"Hey there,

I've been looking for a solution here several times but as the Pistol Whip release is within few hours the issue is highly relevant to me again.

I swallowed the high price of the Vive Pro and then the even higher price (in comparision) for the wireless module plus adapter ( both original HTC). While performance and picture quality is good enough for me for the typical roomscale game, the FPS and picture quality (flickering, artifacts) using wireless while flying Flightsims (DCS etc) was too bad while at the same time wireless isnt really needed. So I converted my HMD back to wired many weeks ago. 

This way I completley stopped playing roomscale games like Blade and Sorcery. However, there must be a solution where I can simply use my Headset in wired more. Power is not the problem. I would even use power bank while video is wired. However, I havent found a cable +  adapter solution for quickly changing to video via HDMI or DP without opening my HMD (it'll break one day).

Any hints?",1573137660.0,12,12,129422

Vive,Modders have once again SAVED Skyrim! 3 essential VR mods...,"For the unaware, some essential modding has resulted in Skyrim VR actually becoming a really decent VR title. I made this video so you can see...

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jap72TIhgDI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jap72TIhgDI)

The video features a full IK player avatar (painfully missing from the original game), allowing you to see yourself in armor (WTF was this missing from the game Bethesda!?!?!), and voice recognition for the real-time selection of spells and dialogue options.

All three of these mods all but eliminate the constant need to pause the game to access GUI elements, destroying your precious IMMERSION!

VRIK PLAYER AVATAR [https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23416](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23416)

The biggest hole in the original game fixed by modders! Providing  incredible immersion to the player by displaying a first person player  avatar that moves in sync with the players movements, with a full  inverse kinematic upper torso. Comes complete with a 3rd person vanity  mode, displays any armor the player chooses to equip, any race or gender  the player chooses to be, and also featuring the ESSENTIAL  FUNCTIONALITY with a 14 slot fully customisable holster system. Store  and retrieve weapons and tools from almost any position on your in game  body!

WAY OF THE VOICE [https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/16379](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/16379)

Allows for the unlocking and selection of any of the vanilla spells  using VOICE RECOGNITION, further freeing you from the immersion-breaking  torture of the Skyrim GUI.

DRAGONBORN SPEAKS NATURALLY [https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/16514](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/16514)

Speak to any NPC in Skyrim with your own voice, participate in the game  like its a MOVIE by READING THE LINES OF THE SCRIPT! This mod knows  which choice you want by voice recognition. As a bonus effect Way Of The  Voice mod also gains from increased responsiveness if you also install  this mod!

So... if you own Skyrim VR I would highly advise you check out these mods and install them... you'd be doing yourself a big favour!

More information can always be found at /r/skyrimvr , thats where I found out!

Thanks! Message me if you need help or have questions! And have fun!

Vive,Battle Dome is still fun to play if you can schedule 10 players,"So we hold a party last night with  around 10 players，we tried to play some popular games like beat saber and Pavlov together but the gap between skill level is so much. 

We have beat saber player who compete on world leaderboard with players who can't finish expert level songs; we have decent Pavlov player with player who are not into shooting game but can beat anyone in tactic games. We can hardly get a balanced PVP game until we tried battle dome.  For co-op games the maxium number I know is Zomday for 8 players.

The game with CTF mode and color map makes every player contribute to its team even if he's not good at shooting. (In color map, player can only teleport to the painted tiles with their team color. Player can paint the block with a paint gun but then they can't use any powerful two handed weapon) We played for 10+ rounds and everyone felt involved.

So, the last time I used vr was on the GEARVR on my old Samsung phone, I never used vr on pc. and I wanted to ask:

1. In general, for 300$, it worth to buy the cosmos even with all the problems (which probably will be fixed in the future, right?)?
2. the problems that everyone talks about is only on games? or it will be effect me even if i will watch a movie?
3. When i watching a movie, can i do that from any distance i want to or i need to stay close to the pc? there is a distance limitations?

Vive,Stage Presence has so much potential but we may be too late...,"It's that game where you do goofy stuff on stage but the real killer feature is the Karaoke mode.
This has the potential to be a killer app and best Karaoke app ever because it puts you on stage singing in front of a huge crowd and it's polished and looks good.

But there's one huge flaw...the audio is garbage.  There's no spatial audio or anything which just kills the immersion.  The game is 2 years old so most likely dead but it's so close to greatness that
maybe if we put enough pressure on the devs they will fix it.

I then unplugged all the cables and tested both the HDMI cables on my PS4 to my TV, both cable worked, I can see my PS4 contents displayed on the TV

The Vive Pro would be far more perfect if there was more space for the nose - if i move the googles outside (like for people who use glasses) i get too much tunnel vision and its not really enjoyable.

Vive,Is there a way to hide or disable the IPD?,"Recently my Vive began to have an issue where if I shook my headset with any kind of force, the IPD would show up as if I were turning the knob. I have messed with the knob so I know it's not just on the cusp of two different settings. It seems like it might be a hardware issue with something loose, but it shouldn't be that big of a deal if I can simply hide or disable the popup message.

I have already tried going to the 'ipdvalue.css' file and editing as many old posts mention as a solution, but there are a couple of weird things.

1. That file didn't exist until I made it, using this link's version of the file: [GitHub](https://gist.github.com/deprecatedcoder/74e65d0d320976f500c533401e9d51a5)
2. Nothing happened when I put it into what I believe is the right spot:  
C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\SteamVR\\content\\panorama\\styles

Does anyone have any ideas on how to fix this? None of the changes I make in that file have any affect on the IPD when it pops up. It's making games pretty much unplayable.

SOLUTION: Courtesy of /r/elvissteinjr

Navigate to: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\SteamVR\resources\webinterface\dashboard\css\systemui.css

Find '.IPDParent' and add: 'display: none;' to it. And that's all there is to it!",1572996106.0,5,19,129422

If anyone is looking at this you have to go into your stream config folder and delete steamvr.vrsettings whole SteamVR is not running. (I’d make a backup somewhere just in case things get screwed up)

Start StramVR and it should reset everything. The only thing is that all your settings including base station power management and controller bindings will get re-set. So make sure you save your controller bindings and remember what your settings are before you do this.

Is it normal to have CPU frame times over 14 Ms on Project Cars 2, for example, even while CPU load is at 40-60% according to fpsVR? It feels like I'm getting performance issues in games despite there apparently being room for the CPU to work harder.

My BIOS settings seem fine, as all the values it detects are accurate, and everything is set to auto. GPU driver is updated. I have no idea what's going wrong. I shouldn't have issues holding 90 fps on a Vive.

Vive,Occasional tracking issues with Index controllers?,"I use lighthouses 1.0, a Pimax 5K+ and Index (Indices?) controllers.

I never had a single tracking problem with Vive wands, 5-stars 100% perfect across the board even on Beat Saber Expert+. Index controllers work fine *for a while*, then eventually become erratic for... a random amount of time.

I used to use Windows 7 and could not install the latest PiTools, but I eventually bit the bullet and downgraded to Windows 10 on a separate HD just to test this. I was thus able to install latest version (1.0.0.180).

The situation improved, but it's not 100% perfect yet. I played Surv1v3 for about an hour, and after about 30 minutes the tracking became so erratic I could not hold a weapon in both hands; going back to the menu and selecting another game mode somehow fixed it.

**QUESTION**

Does anyone else has tracking with Index controllers but not with Vive wands? Is there any way at all to troubleshoot this?

At this point, I suspect that the Pimax headset itself, and more precisely the bluetooth bandwidth with the controllers, could be the reason of this problem.",1572951355.0,5,0,129422

VR E-Sports is missing competitive MOBA games and Cradle of Sins is aspiring to be one. From the early days of developing, we have been working with competing VR gamers who are also taking part in our Alpha testing in order to help shape the game. 

We wish to bring Something that is polished and has a proven track record – a good game that people want to play and will keep playing after weeks of release. We have approached the game with a community first mentality. This has proven successful as we continuously receive constructive feedback from our closed Discord group. They truly have helped us shape the game into what it is today. 

We're about to release the **Official Gameplay trailer** in a couple of days. Made by David Williams (ddubb) and soundtrack composed by an award winning film composer Simone Cilio.

We've recently upgraded our Vive Pro with the wireless kit. So far connection and framerate and picture-quality are as advertised and there's no difference to a wired Vive Pro.

Vive,"None of my ""extra"" dashboard tabs (Advanced Settings, Revive, and Viveport) work anymore.","It's been a few days since I last tried using any of them. I've been doing dev work, so I disabled the chaperone. I'm testing out a new video card I got recently, and tried to disable the chaperone, only to find that the tab is empty. Uninstalling and reinstalling didn't help.

I was ultimately able to re-enable the chaperone by editing steamvr.vrsettings in the Steam install directory and setting CollisionBoundsFadeDistance back to 0.7, which seems to be the default, but I still have the problem of the 3 tabs being empty.

The only thing that's different on my PC since the last time I tried using those tabs is the video card I installed earlier today. It only has 1 HDMI port, so I gave it to the Vive, since I don't have any DisplayPort adapters. I plugged both of my monitors into the motherboard to use the integrated graphics card.

I have a DisplayPort to HDMI cable arriving in a few days, so I'll know for sure if that's the problem, but is there anything else I might be able to do to get these tabs to work, if that isn't the solution? It seems pretty odd for 3rd-party SteamVR dashboard tabs not to work if there are no monitors plugged into the discrete graphics card.

Edit: I tried playing Project Cars 2. The game refused to display in VR. When I started a race, I could look at the game responding to the headset's motion, but the VR view wouldn't actually show up in the headset, and I saw a warning pop up on the SteamVR app saying to plug the headset into the same video card as the primary monitor.

H3VR doesn't have this problem, though, so... bad programming?

Edit 2: fpsVR's tab works fine, also. I'm really thinking this has something to do with some code trying to target a specific GPU or display somehow, and getting screwy when the assumption that the monitor and headset are plugged into the same card turns out to be false. I'll find out when I get an adapter tomorrow.

Edit 3: Plugging my main monitor into the same GPU as the headset, rather than the motherboard, by using an HDMI to Display port adapter fixed all the empty tabs as well as PCars 1 and 2. I don't understand it, but I accept it.",1572852986.0,18,9,129422

Vive,Any OBS tips for VR streaming setup? (Want to avoid frame skipping lag),"So I have my non-vr setup dialed in pretty well so that it doesn't frameskip (Different from dropping frames or lagging) by keeping about 5% of the GPU overhead available to OBS at any given time when streaming. I'm worried that moving to VR is going to tank the GPU though, and assuming I'll need to redo my setup to get decent quality. Here's where I'm currently at:

* Ryzen 1700x OC'd to 3.7ghz
* 1060 6gb OC'd to \~2115 GPU core &amp; \~4680 Mem Clock

SLOBS (Streamlabs obs ) @:

* Base canvas size 1080
* Scaled output 720 bicubic
* 48fps
* x264 CBR 4000 bitrate
* Cpu preset faster
* x264 options opencl=true
* Recording x264, cbr 8000, veryfast, nonscaled
* Slobs set at high priority cpu process

Now, I ***do*** have a vega 64, but I need to RMA it and get a 2060 super or a 5700 xt because it has some serious throttling problems at low resolutions and won't undervolt correctly. (Check my post history if you want to learn more.) So for now, that option is out.

Things I think I can do:

1. Switch to NVEC as the primary encoder to force SLOBS to prioritize the gpu before the game eats it up.
2. Change my x264 preset to veryfast

Things I'm afraid I might have to:

1. Switch to Regular OBS to free up some processor resources bc slobs is hungry
2. Drop the resolution of my local recordings
3. Change my canvas size
4. Edit: I forgot about the option [from my last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Vive/comments/9wgwni/twitch_streaming_problems_with_1060_i53570_slobs/) of using a second rig. I still have my i5 + 970 from last year laying around.
5. Edit 2: ~~Another crazy option - I could put the vega in the second pcie8x slot and dedicated to encoding?~~ I'm told this doesn't work.

Vive,Hey! Question about the wireless power bank!,"So I love my wireless Vive. It was so easy to setup and looks great, though admittedly my Rift S had a nicer display. Anyways, I've been looking into a solution for the low battery life. The issue I'm running into is that I have a 3D Printed holder that I bought that only fits batteries of the official sized ones. So I'm looking for something that is bigger in capacity but the same size as the original battery. Was wondering if anyone had found anything similar that would work. 

I understand it needs to be QC 3.0 to actually work with the Wireless adapter and so far, this is the best option I've found even though it's a bit pricy: [https://www.amazon.com/Grapheme-Wireless-Portable-20000mAh-High-Speed/dp/B07Y9S4WCY/ref=sr\_1\_12\_sspa?keywords=QC+3.0+power+bank&amp;qid=1572788852&amp;sr=8-12-spons&amp;psc=1&amp;spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEyU0w0NlM0SDhLWDFNJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwNjk3NzE3NjdPNkNCTE8yVDROJmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTAxNTg2NDMxNUJPUU5IVDQ2T1dVJndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfbXRmJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ==](https://www.amazon.com/Grapheme-Wireless-Portable-20000mAh-High-Speed/dp/B07Y9S4WCY/ref=sr_1_12_sspa?keywords=QC+3.0+power+bank&amp;qid=1572788852&amp;sr=8-12-spons&amp;psc=1&amp;spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEyU0w0NlM0SDhLWDFNJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwNjk3NzE3NjdPNkNCTE8yVDROJmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTAxNTg2NDMxNUJPUU5IVDQ2T1dVJndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfbXRmJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ==)

Vive,Play all retro games in VR,"Hi guys,

Some of you might see this as old news but only recently i found this and i guess that not everyone here found it already so i'd like to help you guys with how to get EmuVR. It's free btw.

 [http://www.emuvr.net/](http://www.emuvr.net/)  On the website are instruction to get to the download.

You can play all retro consoles on several old tv's, even old dos games, psx and much more. Just like in real life you have to connect the cables, plug in the game cassette or cd's, press the ON buttons, ... You can decorate your room with custom posters, wallpapers, floors, bedsheet, you can even add the pictures/logo's on the cassettes/cd's. It's really cool if you're a fan of retro games.

If you wanna figure out how to get everything working in emuvr i suggest you'd watch these short video's in the developer's playlist  [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLl8MHzvg8QAIALb8WNz-3ttdKfkMiBp-L](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLl8MHzvg8QAIALb8WNz-3ttdKfkMiBp-L) 

It took me quiet some time to put all the pictures on each cassette ect but here is my room in case you wanna see how my virtual room looks like :D [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=075FKPRMfTc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=075FKPRMfTc)

Vive,[Help!] Trackpad (not click related) registers constant touch.,"On one of my controllers, the trackpad registers a constant touch in the 10 o’clock position without my thumb touching it. It clicks down absolutely fine and any other input on the trackpad over rights it. In the SteamVR menu, where you can see you controller, there is a definite dot indicator on the trackpad in the same position.

Resetting the controller fixes problem for a few minutes then will come back a while after. Very annoying in games like Pavlov where it snaps direction and I end up spinning around in circles until I vomit onto my carpet.

Vive,Oculus Rift CV1 vs HTC Vive used?,"

So I really want to get into VR, and im thinking about getting a used rift or vive.
What do you guys suggest? I have never experienced vr before, should I get the rift or the vive? And what is a good price for it? Currently they seem to be going for around £450-499 new.
I found a used rift CV1 (marvel edition) for £180, and most of the used vives are around £200-300.

Thoughts?

Vive,HTC Vive Pre?,"Hi All,

Is there any functional difference between the HTC Vive and HTC Vive Pre? I found a really cheap HTC Vive on facebook marketplace (only 200$), the only difference I noticed between a regular Vive and this headset was the different power plugs, as these had european ones. The seller said he got it as a present from work 2 years ago, but never used it, and if I have any problem with it, he will take it back.

I bought it and brought it home now, and I noticed an HTC VIVE PRE label on the controllers. After a little googling, the only things I found out about the Pre are that they were made a few months before the regular ones for developers, but has the exact same specs as the regular vive. The headset and controllers really look like they were never used before, the base stations even have the foils still on, and there are some unopened bags with cables in the box. If this is functionally the same as a regular Vive, I would like to keep it, as I don't think I could get anything as good as this for a similar price. 

Do you know, if the base stations and controllers for the Pre are working same as the regular Vive? So can I upgrade to a Vive Pro or Pimax headset later, without needing to buy a pair of new base stations and controllers too?",1572656343.0,7,6,129422

However, after the setup downloads software and a setup guide (which is about as big as the software itself, smh), I get the following error:""Close Steam""""Confirm that you've closed the Steam client, and then click ""Continue"".

Steam is closed, nothing in the taskbar, nothing in task manager even when expanded to show all tasks.

As an extra precaution, I tried closing all Oculus software, Viveport, and a bunch of other things, but the message persists and whenever I click ""Continue"" it just comes back.

I tried restarting, I tried reinstalling Viveport, I even tried changing the name of my Steam folder in which SteamVR is already installed, so that setup would not be able to find any files (and presumably do a clean install), but it still gives the same error.

I spoke to a friend who had the same issue, even tried it on a machine on which Steam had never been installed, and he still got the error, but after a few days it went away and he could finally use the headset.

Vive,I bought my vive pro back after 3 months struggle with Index,"I sold my vive pro after I receive my index full set, I really like its controller(which made most revive games not only playable but enjoyable) and the audio is much more stable, no need to play with microphone or headphone setting in steamvr anymore. 

But, the LCD screen is a nightmare as I played Skyrim and Beat Saber most of the time. Black level is terrible no matter how I adjust brightness in steamvr setting. It makes everything unreal and blurry in certain games.  When I bought Index I thought it will only affect visual quality in some dark scene, but in reality even my steamvr home is quite blurry and washed out, Beat Saber felt even worse than my Quest. I thought I will get used to it someday since it did slightly improved visual quality in apps like Pavlov and virtual desktop, but I didn't. I almost burst into tear when I switch back to OLED screen yesterday.  It seems that when supersampling is higher than 1.5 on a 3K screen, the black level is more important than 50% extra subpixels provided by LCD screen. Although I have to admit that I didn't take advantage of Index's 120 Hz flash rate because I can only run my modded SkyrimVR at 90fps The Havok value has to be changed for 120Hz and it causes trouble. Also even with a 2080Ti graphic card and 8700K CPU, you cannot supersampling in most games while running at 120Hz refresh rate. If steamvr could have an option to run apps in different refresh rate, I may use 120Hz in some well optimized games like Superhot or Beat Saber.

I have a friend who also upgrade from Pro to Index, he's using a GTX1080(Supersampling at 1.1 at 90hz) and prefer to play shooting games like Pavlov. For him the Index is an upgrade on every aspects, whether is audio or visual quality. So it really depend on the game you play.

I will still keep my Index for local multiplayer on a second desktop (goodbye my old rift), but I will use Pro as my main headset at the moment.",1572568415.0,15,27,129422
Vive,HTC Vive - Single / Screen issue's [ Green 1 - 4 Pixels Sparkles / Green 1- 2 pixel wide lines / Flashing white with other colors ],"&amp;#x200B;

\- Ok let's start ( Problems/issues that are happening )

1. Green pixels sparkles popping up randomly around the screen ( Also might look like they are white ) ( Each one comes and goes with in less than a second ) their can be many of these or their can be very few of these
2. Thin Green line appearing near the middle of both screens leaving within less than a second happening way less often as the green sparkles do
3. Bottom part or full screen turn mostly white/ mixed a couple other coloured pixels ( most likely the game single still getting thru a little ) This last less than a second but can happen a couple of times in a row really fast and is not always their
4. Screen wicks out like your going cross eyed ( Stays like this intel you restart the headset ( turning off and turning back on steam Vr )

\------------------------------------------------------

Things that I have tried

* Unplugging and replugging all the cables ( HDMI, Power , USB ) have unplugged all and replugged all making sure they are clean - **No results**
* Checked cable for knots or damage that is visible - **Nothing**
* Made sure all connections are in good - **Nothing**
* Turning steam vr direct view mode off - **Stops number 3. from happening also mostly stoped green spakles and lines but not always**

Other notes all these problems are fixed or at least for the time By keeping SteamVr direct view mode turned off also ( maybe from the headset being warm( Thinking maybe the cold weather is acting it up room get really cold )) also when the cable is elevated ( Cable management ) Not sure going to try again

Problem Started 10/29/2019 - Came when playing Vrchat and got it to go away again 45 mins later and worked for the rest of the night

Problem continuous 10/30/2019 - Turned on problem is still their did testing to figure out what the issue is got it to go away with the stuff above - later tested turning Direct view mode back on did the same thing turned it back off it stopped

11/1/2019 Going to do more test maybe also buying a replacement 3 in 1 cable

\-------------------------------------

From what i have found and looked up over the internet, it seems like the 3 in 1 cable has a lot of issues ( did not know about this until I started researching a lot ) Something to do with the hdmi cable itself not being able to support it anymore and it has lost a single one of the hdmi line ( don't know what they are called ) so im going to buy a new 3 in 1 cable and also do further testing and update this more once the 3 in 1 cable comes i will test it and update and say if it fixed it or not

Ps. The problem happens in steam vr and other games also ( Pavlov , steam Vr , Vrchat ) for testing all do it again seems like a single issue or software issue

Vive,"Is there a program that automatically sets your default mic to the VR one when it turns off, and sets it back to your desktop mic when turned off?",I am so sick and tired of having to quit out of the game to go to the settings to then change my default mic. Is there a program that can fix this for me?,1572560525.0,3,5,129422
Vive,This video gives credit to the work that went into everyone that volunteered to make the VR version happen. Thank you.,"I'm not much for scary games but I do love most of the alien movies.  This guy makes me want to at least try the VR version of the game.

Vive,HTC Cosmos - any games ?,"Please name your top games with Cosmos...
I can’t return my Cosmos... now that I am stuck with this unfinished piece of VR headset, what on earth are the games to play with ?
Even to turn on the vr display, I need to enlight my room like crazy and even with this, I have trouble igniting the display... my electrical provider will be happy now...
I tried mastodon games and these are not working such as Skyrim VR, Air Car, No man sky VR... 
I am fed up with Super Nintendo type game provided with Cosmos.
Is there any good games VR ready or even emulated with Vorpx you can suggest ?
Asgard wrath seems to be working only for Oculus.

I took viveport for 2 weeks, and even the video are very disappointing. These dudes are unable to indicate whether it is regular 360 non VR or real VR. 
Stuff officially “best for Cosmos” are even not working such as “Overview” that won’t launch.

Really they are doing their best to screw the VR... 

I recommend Gloomy so, best video experience ever. But overall, even to find a good VR video is a pain in ass... unfreakbelievable. These dudes are unable to create a category as simple as “good badass real VR video in 1440p”

Vive,Extremely Low FPS And Pixelated Display.,"Ok so my Vive Pro Wireless has trash quality (Like maybe 32 pixels an eye) and trash FPS, it may sound like just a trash PC but thing is that it was fine before. I did the SVR performance test again and it is way beyond average, everything green but CPU yellow. So idk but if one of you can help I would really appreciate that.

Vive,R U AFRAID - Pistol Whip Review &amp; Gameplay,"This game gave me the chills as soon as i was in the scene select menu! Last time I felt like this was first time i put on my VR headset and pressed play 18 months ago.

In this game you can play it in many different styles! Play it serious for that accuracy bonus (dont forget though landing your shots to the music gives you more points ;) OR play like me, dancey first shooty second haha!

Thanks to the team at Cloud Head Games and LIV for making it possible to do it in mixed reality, I here have a full play through of R U AFRAID on Normal difficulty. Check it out and i hope you enjoy!

Vive,Red light on headset.,"Currently my Vive is stuck with a red light on the side of the headset. Last night, I was able to get it to work, but that lasted for about 30 seconds before SteamVR stopped detecting it. I've since recreated every step I took to get it to work the first time, I've uninstalled SteamVR (including manually deleting all SteamVR files on my computer), I've restarted my computer about 5 times, I've followed countless guides and posts to no avail, and the only person I know that has a Vive is currently all the way in LA for Blizzcon, which is a hell of a distance from Ohio. **Please** send help.",1572470951.0,2,4,129422

Vive,Where can I buy a Vive?,"Hey folks, simple question here. I'm finally taking the plunge into VR, and I really want a Vive. HTC's website says they're ""out of stock"" and Amazon is only selling them through 3rd party sellers, and currently have less than confidence-inducing reviews. I really want a new-in-box system, and my biggest fear is it being broken on arrival

Does anyone have a reliable source to get one of these systems?",1572408026.0,44,84,129422
