Welcome to our weekly games and experiences recommendation thread! :)



   



-



  



Please share with us what games and experiences you've been enjoying this week.

Here are a couple of suggestions to follow when posting:  



   



-



  



- Please put names of the games/experiences **in bold** for easier skim reading.



   



-



   



- Keep in mind that this is all about personal impressions and opinions so if someone didn't enjoy your favorite title feel free to discuss why but do so in a civil manner. No harassing someone for having a different opinion.

- **Use spoiler tags** when discussing game's plot as to not ruin it for someone who hasn't played it yet.



   



-



  



- Upvote informative and well-written posts to encourage quality discussion.

It will says in the Devices menu ""Oculus software requires restart"". Saturday and Sunday were both fixed in different ways. Today I can't get it working as the setups just throw the ""Sensors can't track headset"" error during sensor check.

Maybe I've missed something while searching for fixes, but I'll list everything I've tried below. It's clearly a software problem as I doubt I would get the same error 3 times, with it being software the first 2 and suddenly hardware on the 3rd.

Saturday
- Restarted software multiple times
- Restarted PC
- Disconnected and reconnected headset
- All of the above in multiple different orders
- Turned off and on camera access in Windows 10 privacy settings - WORKED

Sunday
- All of the above
- Reinstalled Oculus software (took 2 hours)
- Removed Rift S from devices in Oculus software and performed Rift S first time setup again - WORKED

Monday
- All of the above (minus 2 hour reinstall)
- First time setup results in either perpetual sensor check or ""Sensors can't track headset"" error

oculus,Modifying Rift S touch controllers to have a better grip button - Questions,"Hello everyone. I was considering 3d printing a sort of plate or new button to replace the current grip button to be bigger and offer more natural grip of in game items.

Keep in mind, this is assuming you have some sort of way to strap the controller to your hand, something generally like the index has.

My questions are:

Are the grip buttons capacitive? I havent encountered a game that uses it (or can't recall at this moment), if it is. This would most likely make this project dead in the water.

Would the community find this useable or interesting? Consider that this most likely would void any sort of warranty if the final solution requires taking the controller apart.

Any games that this could enhance? B&amp;S and Pavlov come to mind.

oculus,Oculus software fails to reinstall after removing all Oculus software and resetting Windows,"I am running an original rift on a computer I just use for gaming. I hadn't used the rift since February, so when I plugged it in it needed me to update the firmware. No matter how many times I tried to install the firmware, it failed. 

I then decided to just remove all of the Oculus software and reinstall. This failed to work either, as after downloading and on the ""installing"" stage, it will say that it failed to install and suggests rebooting and trying again. I did this several times, but it never seemed to progress any farther. 

I then decided fuck it, just remove Windows and reinstall it and see if that works (I really want to use the rift again). I moved everything off of Windows, did the automated reset and reinstall and chose to wipe everything. I just finished that process, and tried to install the Oculus software again, and it has failed, again. 

I have no idea what else to try now to fix this. Does anyone have any ideas what may be causing this and what I can try?",1575945054.0,1,0,196789

oculus,Yet another Rift S vs Quest report,"I'll try to keep it short.

I own CV1 and OGO and ordered Rift S to potentially replace CV1 and Quest to potentially replace CV1 and OGO.

Here are my findings.

**Rift S**

\-Clarity: ridiculously good, much better than expected. Why were so many people claiming that it's only a small improvment to CV1? For me it's a massive step. I can not just read things more easily than I could before, I can easily read things that I wouldn't have thought were even possible to read in VR.

&amp;#x200B;

\-No more god rays, yay!

&amp;#x200B;

\-Sweetspot? The whole lens is a massive sweetspot. I can look with my eyes in all directions and I don't need to waste any time with adjusting the postition of my headset all the time. This probably also why they can get away with no IPD adjustment.

&amp;#x200B;

\-The cable is longer, yay, I can turn my PC back to facing the right way...

&amp;#x200B;

\-Audio: they've got to be kidding me. I was expecting bad, but this is a joke.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Tracking: didn't notice anything out of the ordinary.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Comfort: I was scared at first, since design reminded me of the terrible Odyssee+ but I have to say: it's even better than CV1.

&amp;#x200B;

\-FOV: this feels really tight, maybe it's the price you pay for the huge sweet spot.

&amp;#x200B;

\-What's that button on the bottom? A mechanism to adjust the distance of the lenses to the face? Wow. Why wasn't anyone talking about this? Will make it much easier to maximise FOV and allow glasses wearers to try the headset.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Passthrough: OMG. Game changer. Put on the headset, don't take it off to have a drink, speak to the wife, get my chair, find my keyboard etc. You can even use it as an AR device where you walk around the room, from one huge screen to the next.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Negatives: Audio, Audio, Audio, and the cable is much more ""sticky"" compared to CV1. Will try to fix it using a mesh sleeve.

&amp;#x200B;

**Quest (Link)**

\-People wern't kidding, it's uncomfortable immediately. Nowhere near Odyssee+ levels of uncomfortableness, so not a complete show stopper, but investing time and money to fix it isn't very appealing to me.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Hello god rays, hello SDE, I missed you.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Visuals: better than CV1, but not close to Rift S.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Audio: same as Rift S.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Supports passthrough but not by double-tapping a button. Wtf?

&amp;#x200B;

\-Volume buttons! Why couldn't they add this to Rift S?

&amp;#x200B;

\-Performance: terrible, smooth 80/90 in Skyrim on Rift (S), 36fps on Quest? What gives? Investigated and it turns out that Quest link has a much higher render target resolution than Rift and Rift S. After reducing it using Debug tools performance was fine, but the fact remains that ASW at 36fps isn't the same thing as ASW at 40 or 45 fps.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Can I sell my OGO? Nope. Many apps aren't available at all, like the Felix and Paul documentaries or Pigasus player. There is no way to switch user accounts other than factory reset (I have two accounts, one for Rift, one for OGO). Sideloading OGO apks to Quest will mostly result in ""entitlement error"", regardless of whether it's a free or paid app, or if it's an app I bought on the active account.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Untethered Quest native apps: for me 72 fps is not really enough buttery smoothness and playing untethered in the same space in which I could just use a cable doean't really seem like a game changer. A game changer would have been if the Quest library had taken off as a VR console with AAA exclusive games like on Switch. But it didn't turn out that way, Quest library are just low-spec and expensive versions of PCVR games. While in the mean time PCVR gets HLA, Asgard's, Stormlands and Boneworks.

&amp;#x200B;

**The verdict**

Rift S much better than I was expecting, just need to buy the Koss speakers. I wanted to like the Quest but for me it has almost zero advantages over the Rift S.",1575928083.0,2,2,196789
oculus,Rift S doesn't work.,"Bought Rift S. Didn't realize i had no USB3. Ordered USB3 PCIe card. Plug it all in. Start setup. Oculus detects its plugged in. Sensor check. Nothing. ""Enable camera in privacy settings."" Okay. Setting was already on. Drivers for USB3 card are updated. What's wrong?

oculus,"Should I gift my father the Oculus Go, or Quest?","So I had my father over a few days ago and showed him Google Earth in VR on my Rift S, and it completely blew him away. He isn't much of a gamer, though he used to be and I could see him going that direction if given a low maintenance option (Rift S and gaming computer certainly is not in the cards). He told me he was thinking about getting something for VR in the near future so I figured this might be the perfect gift for him if I can narrow it down to the right device. I understand that there is a 200 dollar difference and that with the quest you're getting two controllers versus one, and access to more games. How substantial is the spec difference between these two? Is one more user friendly than the other? My gut tells me he is more than likely going to stick to non gaming experiences with the VR, but I'm hoping you all might be able to provide more insight on what he's really going to get out of the Go or Quest.

The right hand controller is only half functioning, half of the ring is out and the other half has IR lights that are extremely dim.

Problem 2:  
When the rift is plugged in &amp; running on my head my internet just conks out, kaput, gone. No idea why, I've attempted to change channels &amp; try running only on 5.0ghz but this has not changed anything at all. (I've tried resetting my internet multiple times too &amp; am unable to use an Ethernet cable)

Problem 3:  
The headset has to be uplugged &amp; replugged in almost every time I first start my PC, and even then sometimes it wont start correctly, forcing me to unplug the cable from the HMD, which 100% of the time fixes the issue.

Have I tried troubleshooting all of these? Yes. I've restarted my computer multiple times, I've messed around with my PC settings (USB power saving etc), I've re-installed the software 3 times now &amp; have tried repairing the install a couple times too &amp; many more methods.

I've tried holding on to it but really at this point I think it's a lost cause, I've been in contact with Oculus but having to wait 2 days for every response is not worth it. It's basically just been 4 days of trying to get the thing to work properly and I don't think the issues are justifying the high price spend.

I don't know if I'm just unlucky or doing something wrong.

Does anybody have any possible solutions to my issues before I end up sending it back to the retailer?

I don't mean to sound rude or dismissive, I am a huge VR enthusiast finally getting into the PC VR market and so far it's just been stressful and if possible I'd love to stick to this headset but these issues are killing me.

oculus,Question regarding Oculus Link and more,"Hello everyone!

I have been saving up for my first VR headset, and I think I have decided on the Oculus Quest. My only problem is that I currently have an NVIDIA GeForce 1050 Ti, and from what I have read Link doesn't seem to support it. My question is- Does anyone know if this graphics card will be supported in the future, or is it just too old? I also have an AMD Ryzen 5 1600 for my CPU just to put that out there if it matters, but I think it is good enough (I don't know computers that well).

Another question that might be harder to answer is- If Link will not support my graphics card, do you think I should just get the Rift S, or should I upgrade my graphics card and then get the Quest? The only problem with this is that it would take me significantly more time to save up for both of these things, and one of the main reasons I want to get a VR headset is to play Steam games (like Elite Dangerous and Boneworks). So in this scenario, would I just be better off with a Rift S? I have heard some people say that the Rift S might become obsolete, and with Link it makes the Quest better in almost every way, but for someone in my position, do you think I should care to this extent? 

Sorry to make this post so long, but with so much money I want to make sure I have considered all my options.

I'm aware that right now there is no ""AAA"" VR game (at least until HL: Alyx), but through ports like Skyrim VR, Fallout VR and unofficial ports like Doom 3 BFG, you can experience really long games in a completely new light.

Ports like these fascinate me, and since I'm a long time fan of the Elder Scrolls series, I wondered if there was a Morrowind port. I found that there was one made a long time ago, called Morrowrift, but that unfortunately didn't have motion controller support and was eventually abandoned.

I'm of the philosophy that if something you want doesn't exist, you should make it, so I set my sights on making a new Morrowind VR port with the new OpenMW engine, since I could have access to its source code.

oculus,Some Love for Westworld Awakening,"Westworld Awakening has been sitting in my Oculus library since launch day and I finally got into it, and boy am I glad I did. I’m not seeing too much love for the game on this subreddit, so I thought I’d share mine.

This is perhaps one of the best VR narratives that I’ve had the pleasure of experiencing, and that’s what this is: an experience mixed with gamey puzzle elements. The polish on this title has blown me away. It’s environments are visually stunning and although the game doesn’t have you shooting and blasting your way out of DELOS, it does have you ducking for cover, sneaking past enemies, and scanning items in the world, all in an effort to further the narrative it’s trying to create--and with great success.

You play as a female Host named Kate, who is programed to experience a living hell day in and day out. Like I said before, you’re not the one doing the hunting and shooting in this story. There are people coming after you, and this game does its darndest to make you feel that way. I felt the sheer terror and vulnerability of being a host, destined to die. It’s astonishing and frightening, much more than I initially anticipated, though it should be noted that it’s not always this way. Westworld Awakening expertly balances horror, adventure, and mystery throughout it’s 4 chapters.

One of the things this game does best is immerse you through its dialogue and characters. Though there aren’t too many to keep track of, those you encounter will be memorable, as you find that most things aren’t what they appear to be. You spend a lot of time listening to a dude through an earpiece, but the dialogue between your character and the guy is so good, you can’t help but feel like you’ve gotten to know the two.

After each chapter, the game will ask if you want to continue, and I always found myself doing so. Similar to the TV show, each chapter leaves the player on some sort of cliffhanger that has you begging to find out what happens next, and that’s just evidence of compelling story-telling. While the story itself isn’t complicated, the way the game puts you in the center of the action makes it that much more engaging. The ending was pretty good. I think it could have been wrapped up with a better final scene, but I was ultimately left satisfied. I think you’ll definitely find it more appealing if you’re a fan of the series, but even if you know nothing about the show, the game gives you enough context throughout your adventure so that you’re not left feeling like some sort of interloper of the fandom.

The only bug I ran into was once when I had to scan objects on walls, but because I already moved made my way into different rooms while the dialogue was still going, I wasn’t able to continue because I assumed progressed too fast and the game got confused. On the flip side, the game does quick-save constantly, so you’re able to reload checkpoints and they’ll spawn you not too far from where you left off.

In terms of locomotion options, both are smooth, and there is no option for teleportation. By default the game is set to arm swing locomotion, where you'll move forward and in the direction your headset is facing when you swing your arms back and forth as if you're walking. Personally, I'm not a fan, so I switched to smooth locomotion via joystick. I don't think the game came with this option when it first released, so kudos to the devs for the update! Also, there's both snap and smooth turning.

Game-length wise, the game spans 4 chapters, with each chapter taking me roughly an hour to complete. I don’t feel as if I rushed through it, but I saw what I wanted to see and read what I wanted to read. Depending on if reading logs on a tablet is your kind of thing, this game may take slightly longer or shorter.

The title is currently on sale on both Steam and the Oculus Store for $29.99, and I wholeheartedly recommend it!

I have the Rift S since last weekend and so far am loving it. However, today I noticed smudges on the lenses, a bigger one on the left lense and a smaller one on the right lense, that I don't seem to be able to clear using a microfiber cloth: [https://imgur.com/a/HEUbTec](https://imgur.com/a/HEUbTec)

I'm wearing glasses and so far have been using the Rift S ""by the book"", only using a clean microfiber cloth provided by my optician, using the button on the headset to provide more space for the glasses and putting the heaset on like described on the oculus website. So I find it a bit annoying, mildly speaking, that the lenses are so sensitive they already caught scratches after one week/maybe 4 longer sessions, even paying attention to all the caveats.

Since I received the headset only one week ago I could potentially return it, but I got it through a special Black Friday deal, and if I were to buy a new one I'd pay 100€ more than I originally paid.

So what would you do in my case? The scratches are not that big, noticeable in VR when paying attention to it, but bearable. My idea would be to get prescription lenses from VR optician or Widmo VR (which one is better, is there any difference?) and if the scratches keep getting worse or start to annoy me more, use something like polywatch. Or do you guys have a better idea?",1575840520.0,3,2,196789
oculus,OG Touch Controllers have broken vibrations,"Hey, so I'm running the OG Rift on my PC (3600 and 5700xt) and the vibrations are messed up. Everything was working fine until Oculus auto-updated drivers. My PC would randomly BSOD during gameplay. I gave it like a week and updated drivers again. No more BSOD and I could play VR again. In Robo Recall, something didn't feel right, but I kept playing. It wasn't until I played Beat Saber when I really noticed the problem:

Touching the Sabers together usually gives a really nice vibration that's rather convincing. Instead, it buzzed for a fraction of a second and stopped. The same went for every time I hit a note.

I thought something was wrong with the motors and that they were breaking. I don't have the money to replace the controllers, so I decided to just deal with it. Then the weirder thing happened.

I have no Idea why, but in Superhot, the controllers vibrate for way too long than too short. Every time I pick up a weapon, it buzzes for 3 seconds. Fire: constant vibration. Finish the level and grab the pyramid? full 10ish seconds of vibration.

At this point I'm thoroughly confused. I'm pretty sure it's not the hardware cause it's different in every game I play. I found a similar thread that said to remove the batteries and reconnect them, but it did nothing. If anybody has an idea, I'll try it, cause nothing I've done has worked.",1575861470.0,1,2,196789

oculus,Anyone else have had a hard time with shipping because Oculus forgot the commercial invoice?,"Ordered my Rift S the 29th during the BF promo. After my card denied the transaction on the 30th (flagged it as fraud), Oculus Support responded to my ticket within 30 minutes and my transaction was fixed.

It shipped last week and my package was supposed to arrive on Thursday. On Thursday, will keeping track of my package, UPS say they are returning the package to sender. I call UPS and they inform me that the sender forgot to put the commercial invoice on the box, so they can’t ship it to Canada and that I should contact the sender (Oculus).

I then proceed to open a ticket explaining the situation, waiting a day without answer. After a live chat with an agent, they inform me that I would need to wait for them to receive the returned package and then wait 4 business days for them to investigate. I inform them that it seems like a pretty long delay and that in about 2 weeks I will be away on vacation without internet access, which is a bit troublesome given the situation. I said it would be much faster to simply send a new unit, as the error is on their part and the package never even left the US.

A day later, someone else replies to my ticket informing me that I will be receiving a reimbursement in 5-7 business days and that I would be able to re-order another Rift S by then, ensuring that I update my shipping info (implying there was an error with my shipping info when there wasn’t at all, I checked).

I responded that I did not want to order a new Rift S at full price when I bought mine at the BF reduced price. I contacted the live chat and the agent told me that he forwarded that to a new team which will respond to it in 4 business days.

Is this really supposed to be this way? I feel like this is getting ridiculous as I made no error placing my order and now I’m stuck on knowing nothing about what or when anything is going to happen.

Did anything similar happen to any of you? What was your experience? How did it get fixed?

oculus,QUESTION: Can I force USB 2.0 with a USB 2.0 Cable?,"Funny situation.

Ironically, possibly the only situation where having only USB 3.0 for your I/O is a downside. That's right. Not a single lick of USB 2.0. Rear I/O, 3 separate dual USB 3.0 ports side-to-side. A thunderbolt port. And just the standard video/audio ports. Two USB 3.0s on the front too, dang.

Oculus recommends putting any 3rd or 4th sensor on USB 2.0. Many say this is helps prevent any tracking issues. I reckon it's because having 3+ sensors gobbling USB 3.0 bandwidth is a sure way to slow things down. 

Thankfully, I have USB 2.0 extension cables laying around.

If the ground looks too far, *facing the wearer*, slide the IPD left (smaller IPD).  If the ground looks too high, slide right (larger IPD). Wait a second for eyes readjust, then refine until they say it looks right.

I've had my ASUS WMR for the last year and it's worked well - I enjoy it a lot although I do have some gripes with it. Calibrating height with WMR feels like it's harder than it should be, and some games don't feel great until you finally find good controller settings. I don't have a ton of space in my room, so I generally do just a standing experience at the moment.

My real question is, does the Rift S have better tracking than WMR? And better clarity? I can't really change the IPD of the Asus headset, so what I have is what I get, but I think the Rift S can have that changed?

oculus,Why does nobody talk about the small Rift S FOV?,"So, first of sorry if my english is not perfect, it's not my first language.

&amp;#x200B;

I currently have 3 VR headsets at home: Oculus Rift S, Quest and now even an Index.

The FOV of the Rift S is so bad I just can't play with it anymore and am now in the process of selling it. The FOV of the Quest isn't alot better then the Rift S but it feels so much better and immersive while the Rift S takes me complete out of the immersion. So I even prefer to play with the Quest through Oculus Link then with the Rift S.

Some people might say it's because of my IPD (it's not I have 63)  or because of the cover and it's not close enaugh to my eyes but no, I am able to put the headset that close to my eyes until I see all 4 edges of the screen, it looks like I'm watching through a carboard box which is even more immersiom breaking, and still the FOV is much smaller then the Quest while I can't see any edges of the Quest.

&amp;#x200B;

So that is the only reason why I bought the Index. I really like the Oculus software, the tracking, the controllers, and the screen of the Rift S but the FOV is just too small for me.

The Quest seemed to have the most bang for buck on the market because of its standalone and pc link capabillities.

I bought it tried it, and these are my impressions so far:

Pros compared to the gear vr:
- coming from a Gear vr positional tracking is a game changer foe me
- everything seems clearer, more optimized and snappier
- i love the 3d outside camera
- having hands inside the quest, much much better than the gear vr controller
- link
- standalone
- i use floorplanner.com for floorplans and now im able to walk around in the 360 vr exports of my floorplans

Cons compared to the Gear vr:
- there is some light refraction visible on the lenses
- there is some space around my nose where outside light comes trough
- eye strain after 10 minutes which worse and worse untill im unable to use the quest around the 15 min mark

It's the old Question... What should I get for Christmas? 

I heard the Rift S has better visuals and (besides apparently lower resolutions) sharper images. Quest has better colours and a higher resolution per eye (but not as sharp pictures, even with Link) and apperently gets more support from oculus (handtracking, for example) 

I mainly want to play games and watch Movies with my future headset. 
The Quest has apperently more opportunities but the Rift is more comfortable. 


And because it matters: I have a gaming Laptop with a RTX 2060. And I am a guy who enjoys having good graphics 
(Would the Quest doesn't have the Link, it would be a no-brainer for me, but now the wireless seems like a really cool additional feature, which could be nice to have...)

Oh, and because I am posting anyway.

When both Ocolus Store and Steam offer the same game (for the same price) where should I buy it?

Can you give some advice on this?",1575821903.0,0,13,196789

oculus,"Just got Rift S, disappointed in my Systems Performance","I just got my rift S yesterday and I am a bit disappointed in the performance. I started off with a few demos like The Lab on steam, and some simple games like Sports Scramble on the oculus store. So I decided to get a more demanding game, Stormland.

Have a 1070 ti, i7-4790, 16 gigs of ram and in Stormland if I run it on medium or high settings the frame rate drops to 40hz in most places and aws kicks in. I have to run it on low settings to get 80 hz. What would improve my performance the most, a CPU upgrade since that is older? I thought the 1070 ti was still in the top 10 cards.

I have also read that this game in particular might be harder than other newer games to get good performance on so I am not sure.",1575819633.0,1,7,196789
oculus,Oculus should really release more facial interfaces for the Rift S or at least release some CAD files so other can do so.,"My biggest gripe with my VR experience lately is that the facial interface just doesn't fit my face well and it's not very comfortable compared to my old CV1.  I have bought every 3rd party accessory I can find to improve the comfort but at the end of the day, the thing is just not shaped right for my face.   Maybe one day VR cover will release a new plastic interface, but I feel like this is an easier problem for Oculus themselves to solve, and an important one to address if they want to continue to grow the user base.

If you want to reduce friction to get people into VR, comfort is REALLY important.  I can be playing the best game in the world but if I'm feeling discomfort ON MY FACE of all places it's kinda hard to keep playing.  The HMD is a piece of clothing basically and the facial interface is where the HMD meets the face, it's really important, but so far is has not really been treated as such.

I see a lot of people on here over the years with the same problem and it seems pretty obvious it needs to be addressed.  People have all kinds of different face shapes and a one size fits all solution is doomed to leave many people uncomfortable.  

 All that Facebook money is great for doing the big R&amp;D stuff like varifocal lenses and cool new robot vision, but this problem is just molding some plastic a few different ways so people can be more comfortable.  This is low hanging fruit, but a big deal to the users.  

At the very least outsource the problem to the community and let us solve it but with some support from Oculus to help.  3d printers are pretty common, just give out the specs for printing the snaps so people can build their own and maybe sell them on etsy or something.  Or just sell a plastic plate with the snaps that we can glue our own solution to.  Or go all next level and do some kinda face scanning software that lets us 3d print a custom fit plate, that would be so Batman/Carmack.  And on the next headset, the magnetic snaps like the Index is using are a good idea, just copy that and make it easy for us.

I've had the CV1 for almost 2 years now (got it for Christmas from the best wife EVER) and I'm curious to try the Rift S.  I haven't used my CV1 for a few months, and wanted to get back in to Elite Dangerous and really wanted to see a resolution bump.  I've heard so many great things about the S, but my worry is that it might not be quite good enough to justify spending $550 to buy when I already have a CV1.  I looked up online where I could try the Rift S, drove an hour to the Microsoft Store in Square 1 Mississauga, only to be told that they removed the demo unit from the planagram a month ago.  Of course, it still (to this day) says you can try it out there.  There is no where else in Canada on Oculus' website that says where you can try it.  Best Buy says you can't return VR once its been opened, thus I'm in this pickle.

The things that worry me are:. 
1: Low field of view. 2: visible pixels. 3: Bad sound quality. 4: washed out blacks. 5: cheap foam that can't be removed. 
  
My IPD is 63.5mm, so I guess that would be ideal?
  
I'm also thinking that it might be better to wait for a future product that could be better, but perhaps that won't happen for a long time?

oculus,I'm happy to say Boiling Steel is really good.,"If you like Sci fi shooters, killing lots of robots and just having a good time, this game might be for you.

Boiling steel is really fun imho. I have played it now for about 2-3 hours and I'm nowhere near the end.
It starts off somewhat basic, lots of boring dialogue and initially the shooting seems kinda basic. But the more you play you realize this part of the game was essentially an extended tutorial.

The real game starts after the third or so mission, maybe about 30 to 40 min. After that the game greatly opens up, allowing you to select your own mission and even do bonus missions for special rewards. 

The way the game works you are essentially a human who operates robots remotely. Something happens at the beginning of the game that makes all sorts of robots go crazy and attack the humans. It is up to you to find out what happened and how to fix it. I can't say much about the story but at this point I'm certainly intrigued and want to see where it goes. I've already seen one or two revelations  that intrigued me.


You go in missions, get rewards and upgrade your robot and your weapons. This ain't an rpg but there's certainly a progression system that you feel yourself getting stronger and more capable. 

The starting weapons are extremely weak and little by little they are getting better. But one of the most interesting things of the game is how you equip/ reload these weapons. 

You basically hold the grip button of your non dominant hand and a hologram shows up with your long range and your short range weapon. Then with your other hand you grip the hologram and expand it. Then the weapon materializes in your hand.  According to the story they are being ""teleported"" from somewhere. There's no reloading. Once the weapon runs out of ammo you have to do this all over again. 

So far all the weapons I've gotten are two handed but they are all pretty varied and have different handling and uses. 

The missions are usually pretty basic, go here, unlock this, open this gate etc but the combat is what really shines. Theres several types of enemies and they are pretty good at taking cover, throwing grenades and rushing you. 

Overall the combination of the combat, the weapon system, the story, the progression has made this game pretty enjoyable for me. 

For 20 bucks, you hardly can go wrong. I'm playing this on viveport and the viveport version actually supports oculus home from what I can tell. Runs as smooth as any native oculus game that I've seen. No hitches or anything. And also a lot of settings to tweak for comfort etc (game defaults to headset orientation) 

Give it a try, I'm sure if you are a fan of single player  shooters you will enjoy this a lot.

Edit : apparently the game is about 4 to 5 hours long according to the dev with more hours to be added as the game progresses in early access. (probably should have mentioned it is early access)

Another big criticism is that the game is definitely budget and indie. A lot of the voice acting is actually text to speech (a computer is talking to you). And the levels are reused for the missions.",1575761128.0,8,1,196789

First off, we’d just like to say thanks to everyone who has supported us so far and welcome any newcomers to N1NE: The Splintered Mind.

We’re so grateful for all the support and feedback for the game we’ve received since we released our Alpha reveal trailer.

Today we are making an [announcement](https://www.od1nstudios.com/n1ne-the-splintered-mind-development-update/) that the team here has thought long and hard about. It’s not an easy decision for us but we feel it’s the best way for us to deliver a game that has a level of quality we as a team can be proud of.

And so, we are delaying the release of N1NE: The Splintered Mind Part 1.

We’d like to explain our decision making process in hopes of better communicating with all of you and strike a level of understanding for why we made the choice.

We also want to give you an update on where we are at and a look into the game, so we've written a blog post on our website with some additional info and new screenshots.

oculus,Unpopular Opinion - I prefer Rift S to Valve Index,"Hey All, fairly new to VR here. Little backstory  

&amp;#x200B;

I ordered a Valve index a few weeks ago, and was super excited. Boneworks, then HL:A, and Asgards Wrath (through Revive), I was just so excited! So excited in fact... That I couldn't wait to jump in, and ran out and bought a Rift S to play in the meantime, and maybe gift to my nephew once my Valve Index got in. I have been OBSESSED! I spent a ton of money on the steam VR sales, black friday oculus sales, and have been having a blast. But in the back of my mind was always the thought - ""This is going to be so much better when my Index comes in!""

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to this last Monday, got my Index, set it up (pain in the ass) and started playing. I was immediately disappointing. my first complaint was how much heavier the headset feels compared to my Rift S. It's noticeable, and I was constantly aware of it. Second issue - my play space is too small for the Steam VR ""full room scale"" chaperone set up (Valve's version of guardian"" so I couldn't even use it! I love my Rift S guardian, and has saved my ass a ton of times when playing Blade and Sorcery! Third issue, the cables dangling genuinely felt heavier, I noticed them more. It's a thicker cord, it weighs more than the Rift S, and it's noticeable. Forth issue (and it's a big one) I kept noticing these massive shines coming through my lenses while playing.. Like glare of some kind. I thought I had a defective unit, until I learned that it's something called ""Godrays"" and BOY is it bad. Like, REALLY bad when comparing to my Rift S. it was a constant distraction and I noticed it all of the time. 

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly? The amazing Oculus exclusives, eco system, recent innovations coming out of the Oculus team, makes me really excited about the future and investing into the Oculus eco system. Yeah, the on-board speakers suck ass, but I have a really good computer speaker set up, and just crank the volume when playing in my office and it works fine for me. 

Is it just me? Am I crazy? i don't get what is so amazing about the Index? 

Anyways, that's my two cents. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - I much prefer the Oculus Rift S over the Valve Index having owned both of them, and will be returning the Index for a refund.",1575694071.0,33,68,196789

I just picked up a Rift S on black Friday and for some reason when I try to use it I get stuck in a loop of ""Oculus software restart required"" constantly.

It almost always says the stuff about having to restart the software but occasionally it says something about having no display port connection, though that is pretty rare.     


I have tried everything i have been able to find online to fix it. I've fully uninstalled/reinstalled the software, updated Windows/GPU drivers, and changed settings all over the place.

oculus,Getting fed up with the Guardian system.,"This just isn't working for me. I need to switch off the Guardian system to play Elite Dangerous, Dirt Rally games, Project Cars 1 &amp; 2, etc.. Every time I switch it off I am never in the center of the view, it's always to the right of me. If I goto the Steam VR settings, reset my seating view, reset my head view and I am back in the center - the Steam view you see before entering a game with the stars, distant mountains and a grey area at your feet - this grey area is in the center. Run a game, any of the above games I mentioned, and I am back to left of the grey area - so as I look down it's to the right of my view. So, in any of the games, I am either outside the car, outside my ship in ED, outside of any sitting down game.  
Of course, I can't just move to the right because my PC is where I need to be sat at, so a move to the right and I am not sitting at my PC.  
At the moment, the only way out of this is to switch the Guardian system back on, grab a chair and sit directly in the middle, but then my PC is way to the left of me.  
This is just so damn frustrating because one would think that switching OFF the Guardian system would also switch off any need to have a center of anything, the center should always be your headset.

oculus,Nostos First Impressions,"FYI: I never played the beta but heard some pretty bad things from the community and recently from Eric for President. I decided to give it a go anyway.

I played it for \~15-20 excruciating minutes, and then had to stop because it was so unenjoyable. Couldn't run it on high settings--it was a stuttering mess, so I turned it to low. Still a stuttering, janky mess. It's the kind of nauseating thing that VR games often do when they're loading, where a still image flickers rapidly and you become disoriented as you move your head. Let it be known that this game doesn't give you advanced video options. It's just Low-Medium-High.

The first red flag is at the very start, where this little robot thing asks you to calibrate yourself, then asks if you can see yourself in the mirror. It motions at the ground as if to tell the mirror to come up and, as if in an attempt to be funny and charming, the mirror doesn't show up until 10 seconds later. The arms on my girl avatar, according to the mirror, was way off. When I had my hands by my side IRL, the model had its right hand in her body toward the middle.

When you finally enter the game, you get this wrist watch thing ever so slightly reminiscent of what you get from Stormlands but not nearly as functional or just plain good. You can access it sometimes, other times, you can't. I tried changing graphics options from inside the options menu, but couldn't. The only way to do so is to return to the menu screen.

Let's talk about controls/gameplay. Maybe it's just me, but moving around felt like there was some sort of input lag so you end up gliding forward much longer than you want to. To run, you hold the grip which launches you every which way, making it even hard to control where you are. I played as a dude and somehow, some way, without clear directions, ended up in the open wild. Decided to shoot some deer with the pistol they gave me but I had to lead my shots an unreasonable amount. It dropped a slab of meat. Once I ran out of ammo, I had a landmine at my disposal, but it was virtually useless. Two bandits came up to me and started shooting me so I tried to punch them--there was audio feedback, but their HP didn't appear to go down. Once they'd shot me to the ground, one of the npcs game to my aid but started losing the battle, so I was left on the floor to die.

There's no tutorial to speak of, which left me confused about how things worked. That's not a good sign.

Over voice-chat, you can hear people going, ""What the \*\*\*\* is this? How do you do this/that? What's going on? Why is it loading forever?""

For what it's worth, it's a good looking game and from what I saw in the main hub, seems like there's a decent amount of people trying Nostos out too.

But this doesnt feel early-access. This feels early-*early* access.

For those of you who've tried it, what are your thoughts?",1575681615.0,12,11,196789

We released new free DLC for Swords of Gargantua, called Tesseract Abyss!

It's a rogue-lite mode that can be done solo or through multiplayer. Players move downwards into the ""abyss"" fighting in different areas that are chosen from a random selection after each stage.

Along the way you'll earn power-ups, can collect weapons, craft them into stronger weapons and level up your own character's base abilities. There'll even be a shop that appears from time to time which you can buy items (like power-ups and health) through the coin you earn by winning battles.

If you die, you'll carry everything over into the next play minus your initial level. It's pretty tricky so you'll most likely die a few times. Looking forward to seeing everyone progress through it!

oculus,How to Narrow Down the Right VR Headset,"For the last week I have been on a VR rampage, getting my hands on several different headsets in order to find the best experience for me. To find the headset I would be willing to live with for the next few years. I had read reviews, did my research, but I felt a lot of the feedback I was hearing was unfocused. People were hesitant to recommend things because things weren't 100% good about any one headset. Conversely, there were many things that people valued far more or less than others. Well, I want to solve that problem by narrowing down use cases. You decide what is most important to you by seeing what scenario fits. This is, of course, from my own perspective.

*You will need to know some basic information about the Steam Index, Oculus Rift S, and Oculus Quest to make sense of this guide.*

**Pre-Requisites:**

What do you need prior to playing VR with the kits below?

* Index: Super Computer. 1080/2080+
* Rift S: Gaming computer. 1060/2060+
* Quest: None. All in one solution.

**Mobility:**

A rating of how easy it is to move your configuration. The wired headsets here are not too difficult to play in seeing as the wires are greatly improved from last gen, so that's less of an issue.

* Index: Dedicated space recommended. Since it uses tracking beacons the best way to get them to work is to mount them. Wires need to be managed regardless of if they are mounted on a wall or a tripod. Moving this system is definitely going to take effort and it's unlikely you will want to move around with this system. If you don't have a dedicated space, or can't see yourself playing in the same space more than 80% of the time, this will be troublesome.
* Rift S: Mobile. The wire is very manageable, and with a dedicated VR laptop (That needs Mini-DisplayPort connected to your GPU) you can be mobile. The headset has all the tracking tools built in, so you are surprisingly mobile. Play downstairs one minute and upstairs the next.
* Quest: Absolute Freedom. VR makes a lot of people conscious and worrisome about the world around them. Well, with the Quest, you have zero wires. It's the future of VR on a general level.

**Comfort:**

* Index: Very comfortable. A little heavy, but felt well balanced. Did not wobble. Best materials.
* Rift S: Comfortable. I would argue very comfortable, but the halo ratchet didn't always feel secure. I did not like the foam as much as the Index's cotton layered padding. Will definitely need Silicone or VR Cover.
* Quest: Comfortable. Most similar to the CV1 in terms of attachment. It requires a lot of fidgeting to get right, but I never had a need for a counter weight once I figured it out. I think people overstress the added ""weight"" as it's only \~70g heavier than the CV1 in the front. It probably helps because it adheres to your face more. There is more wobble on the Quest than the Rift S, but at the same time there are better comfort accessories for the Quest too. If you spend more money the Quest might edge out the Index.

**Visuals:**

* Index: A+. The best visuals I tried. No god rays, just light blooming. Don't be fooled by the fact that it's an LCD because when it comes to VR LCD is king. Don't mistake your monitor's contrast ratio with this thing. Just like TVs have specially adapted pixel configurations to increase contrast (or your iPad for instance), the VR headsets have the same. LCD has less banding, no speckle, and far less SDE. The improved refresh rate of the Index makes it the king of the three. If you get motion sick, the Index is the only headset that may resolve it.
* Rift S: A. Everything above, other than the refresh rate and FOV, applies here. This headset's visuals are not that far off from the Index and that's due to the lenses. The best analogy I can make is a 23"" 1080P monitor and a 27"" 1440P monitor. It's obvious the latter is higher resolution and more dense, but because the 1080P screen is smaller the density is similar (\~97 vs \~109 PPI) the difference isn't mind shattering. The reduced refresh rate is noticeable for owners of the CV1, but it doesn't harm the gaming experience. That being said, I own the 1440p monitor in this example and even though it's only 12 PPI that mattered to me. You might be the same?
* Quest: B. If you've used the CV1, you can think of this as a CV1+. It's unfair to say it isn't different, because text is far easier to read and god rays are greatly reduced, but there are similar OLED issues that remain. SDE is reduced but far more noticeable than the above headsets. Brightness suffers as a result. 72hz is noticeable, but has yet to affect gameplay for me. If you suffer motion sickness this headset might not be for you at all. There isn't jitter, but movement isn't as smooth. Pistol Whip is hard to play compared to on CV1. The B rating is above average though, so we're at a place where visuals aren't something you are suffering through, but simply something better exists.

**Controls:**

I don't think this is a significant talking point. I don't prefer the Oculus controllers versus the old CV1, but they aren't bad. Valve's controllers have additional features but they aren't really necessary in the VR world currently. You're getting a quality controller regardless fo what platform you pick.

**Value:**

* Rift S and Quest are the best value. The Index is a luxury item in my standards. For the money you pay, it delivers. But at some point you are happy with your iPhone X and don't need an iPhone XI. When you buy a Rift S or a Quest you aren't buying yesterday's product either, so there's no sense of ""I wasted money on old tech"". You are buying the newest products that Oculus has to offer. Valve's product is better, but not a better value.

**Sound:**

The Index is the only VR headset with a real audio solution. I'm a little weird in that I like the Rift S' open audio because it allows me to be more aware of my surroundings (and it's immersive because you hear audio without having your ears covered) but that's not the norm. I like it, but I still prefer the Index. Hell, even the CV1's headphones were great and they are missed.

With both the Rift S and the Quest you will need to invest money in another audio solution if you want headsets.

**Quest Link (beta):**

This is specifically for the Quest, but it's usually the most difficult topic regarding getting the Rift S or the Quest. For most people, the lower visual quality of the Quest in Link is worth the mobility and freedom. They just need to make sure Quest Link WORKS.

Quest Link is solid.

If you're playing native Quest apps and you have no issues with the loss of visual fidelity there (due to the mobile processor) and you just want to make sure you can play Half Life: Alyx or some other PCVR titles -- you're good. It works wonderfully for a beta. It's plug and play. The visuals are still great.

However, if you're thinking you want to be playing PCVR more often; if you bought a beefy GPU because you wanted awesome VR graphics and crisp visuals... Quest Link isn't that. It's like playing 1080p games on your 4K monitor. It looks fine, but it's noticeable. 

If you want Quest as a Quest, Link is an added bonus that feels like cheating at life. If you want Quest as some sort of value proposition between your gaming PC and Mobile VR, it's doable without major complaints. If you think Quest Link compares or replaces Rift S/Index in experience however, you're going to be very sorely disappointed. **I have no idea how so many youtubers and reviewers could ever say playing Quest Link felt no different than Rift S.** Just 1 minute in Link and I could easily tell. I'm not some magical gamer -- you'd have to be blind not to know. Whether you care or not is not the same as there being almost no literal difference. That is ***absolute bullshit***.

Perhaps they will fix it in future updates, but Quest Link has slight glitching in visuals every so often. Sometimes objects teleport a few inches (in game perspective) as the stream takes time to catch up during intense gameplay. Vader Immortal's Dojo showed this often when critters would pop up and move around. There's also a very, very slight lag in audio and controllers. I'd say you will never choose to play Beat Saber over Link. Score or Performance didn't drop for me much, but you notice the visual glitches. You will actively recognize that a block sliced open a little closer to your face than you're used to. However, you might be fine playing a game that is intense but not nearly as rapid -- like Stormland or Elder Scrolls VR. Using Half Life as an example again, I can see myself playing it over Link without many complaints.

**What Did I Pick?**

Playing *more* VR supercedes playing *better* VR, in my opinion. This is why I moved on from the CV1 to begin with; the increased visual fidelity was merely an unexpected bonus. While I fell in love with the Valve Index, I don't have a dedicated play area. I have to move between two spots depending on my opportunities so that narrows down my choice. Picking between Rift S and Quest was difficult, but I ended up deciding on the Rift S. Quest is fun without a tether, but I have a gaming laptop and the cord doesn't bother me so much. It feels no different to me than having wired earbuds on.

Happy Holidays and I hope you all find the headset you need!",1575665191.0,14,11,196789
oculus,Oculus Rift S - feeling underwhelmed - what am I missing?,"I hesitate to post a negative thread here but ive been really disapointed with my experience so far.  I've wanted an occulus since they were first announced years ago.  I pulled the trigger on Black Friday. 

So far, the highlight has been the tutorial demo.  I thought that was pretty amazing.  It's been downhill since. 

I installed Steam VR and downloaded one of the free rollar coaster games.  It was kind of cool but didn't feel immersive at all. 

I purchased vorpX and tried a few games. I got maybe two of them to work but again - I was not blown away.  

What am I doing wrong?  Do I pretty much need to only use apps and games purchased through the Oculus store to get the.same.experience that blew me away like the tutorial did?

I hope someone can help give me advice because otherwise this thing is going back to the store. 

Thanks",1575737529.0,0,39,196789
oculus,Oculus Rift S Headphone Jack Audio Issues,"So ever since I bought the Rift S I've absolutely loved it. I think the one persistent issue I've noticed since opening the Rift S is that my Apple Earpod headphones don't seem to want to sound right unless the jack is sitting in an absolutely specific position often moving back out of position during play which results in audio cutting out of the right headphone.  Sometimes even only plugging it in halfway will give me better audio in both headphones than all the way in which will cut out most of the right headphone unless you twist it just right.

And no, the headphones work perfectly fine in any other device and are not damaged near the jack. The Rift S Headphone Jack is super touchy with jack position. I usually only get this issue with cheap 3.5mm headphone extenders previously. More higher quality 3.5mm extension cords don't have this issue like the current one I'm using for my PC audio into these very headphones that give me issues on the Rift S jack.",1575702097.0,2,2,196789

Upgraded from a HP WMR that had zero FPS issues at 90Hz/FPS, got the rift S and having some problems, mostly at level loads or when something happens in the game (explosions, things spawning, etc) every few minutes.  
I'll get FPS drops and get visually smearing (looks like wet glass) as well as stuttering, even my controllers in game jerk around. CPU and GPU usage seem low at the time it happens.

Ryzen 1400 @ 3.9Ghz (stock vs OC makes no difference)  
16GB 2666Mhz corsair ram  
GTX 980 4GB (stock speeds)

CPU and GPU pass all sorts of benchmarks and dont pass 60C on CPU and 75C on GPU, CPU and GPU usage dont max out in task manager.

But, when I put it on it was just black.  It's connected to USB 3 port and had no problems updating firmware.

I ran the 'Oculus checker' software and my PC meets specs (nvidia GTX1060, 16G ram, USB 3, etc).

Has anyone else had this problem and been able to resolve it? I'm pretty upset that after buying it and making sure my laptop was fine that it's not working.

Edit: not sure why people are down voting this... with the black Friday sales I'm sure other people are likely facing the same issue.

So im in th emarked for a vr headset, and its down between the Quest and the Rift S. The issue is, im not gonna keep my pc in the same room as i would like to VR in. The computer room is to small to do much flailing around, and i dont wanna keep my pc in the living room, because i use it for other stuff besides gaming. So i need about 5-6m extension on the cables. Its also one of the reasons i dont care for the Index, cause id need to run a ton of cabling trough the middle of my apartment. 

Has anyone tried this? Would it be easier to extend the link with an active usb 3 cable? Or the rift S with a display port repeater and some aditional cabling? Would any of those options even work? At this point this seems to be the deciding factor for me, cause they both seem to have a bunch of advantages and disadvantages.

oculus,Don't sleep on Boiling Steel!,"We are suddenly blessed with tons of really good VR content. My library is already a guilt ridden mountain of unfinished games. Recently, we have had some real hard hitters - finding time to play though Asgards Wrath and Stormlands is hard enough. So, this is the first year I passed on the sales - I just do not need any new games. 

Then Boiling Steel comes along. I had my eye on this for some time, saw a couple of enthusiastic reviews (well, 'let's play's'). I thought, 'this game seems legit' - but I stood my ground... no new games 'till I clear some of the back catalogue.

Then I noticed Boiling Steel pop up on Infinity - so I downloaded it. Now I am going to buy it on Steam (Infinity - for me = good for demoing games that I will buy on Steam if I like them). 

Everything about this game puts it up there with the very best VR shooters (perhaps... even my current darling: Stormlands).

Graphics are really, I mean \*really\* good. Gameplay is solid and innovative, and everything about it just 'feels right'. 

There is a very different feel to most shooters (VR or not). You see, there are no health packs lying around (if you think about it - having convenient health packs just lying around - is pretty dumb, unrealistic and immersion breaking in any game). *Here* you have to conserve your health - get though by playing smart and taking as few hits as possible. Dash, forward to hit, or dash back to evade - fight more tactically. This gives the game some genuine tension and sense of achievement. There is no - 'I'll kill this guy, pick up his health pack and suddenly, I am 100% again'. 

The only bad thing so far is the voice acting - the main GI Joe voice is like fingernails on a blackboard. But that's it - everything else is up there with the very best. 

Putting this game out now is poor timing - had this come out before AW and Stormlands - I am pretty sure everyone would be flagging it up - and I fear many will pass, or not even notice what is a truly great game.

oculus,Anyone able to give me some advice on upgrading my PC ?,"Hi.
Owned an Oculus for about a year and I love it. My current system runs a heavily modded Skyrim VR smooth as butter but recent games like Asgards Wrath and Stormlands are starting to have issues so I'm thinking it's time to upgrade. Problem is, I'm not sure what. My PC has basically been hammered together over several years, I'm not even really sure what's in there at this point but a system scan tells me I'm running:

Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-6700K CPU @ 4.00GHz 

Radeon RX Vega 

16 GB DDR3 RAM

Windows 10 64bit

So my question is, what to upgrade ? I'd rather go heavy in one or two areas rather than a little boost across the board. I'm budgeting about £500 and I'd like to put in an SSD to improve loading times ( especially for Asgards wrath my 2 year old 2TB drive really doesn't like loading that game ) but should I go for more RAM or a faster CPU ? I could get a new graphics card but the Vega is only about a year old and should handle stuff pretty well.

so yeah. An SSD and what ? 64gig of ram or a fancy new processor ?

Any advice gratefully received.",1575687703.0,1,2,196789

No Man's Sky has exhibited some noticeable issues on my W10 system, which consists of:

i5 6600k (Stock)
Sapphire Nitro+ 5700XT 8GB OC
16gb DDR4 

Based on some light research, NMS in VR is very CPU intensive due to the nature of the game itself, which matches up with the issues I've had (slow to render/black portion of view when quickly moving head, stuttering when moving at high speed, and during star field intro/loading screen).

In search of a solution, I'm debating which upgrade path is the best and most cost effective for my predicament. The i7 7700k is the fastest CPU my LGA1151 board will accommodate. Can I expect this to provide a noticeable boost and the alleviation of these issues, or should I spend some more for a new AM4 motherboard with a Ryzen 3800x?

Mostly looking for opinions and first hand experience from those with a 7700k. Would I be wasting money taking that route? Also, maybe someone has a tweak in mind for NMS that makes a difference?

I've been searching around for answers and it seems that this question has been asked many times but never really answered other than ""revert to an older version of windows"" or ""format"" or ""update your drivers"".

It worked perfectly fine before but now it doesn't so if you are using DK2 be weary about updating. Unfortunately the error from the BSOD is ""IRQL NOT LESS OR EQUAL"" which relates to a memory leak of some kind. Unfortunately digging deeper into the problem I find that it's absolutely related to the USB exe file ""ntoskrnl.exe""

I tried Microsoft verifier, sfc scannow, memtest, checked drive for errors etc... No issues anywhere. It doesn't matter what cable I connect to the sensor, it just BSOD the moment the sensor turns on (config window or in-game) but does appear to work for a brief second.

oculus,360 degree video app that allows perspective change via controller in addition to head movement?,"I have an Oculus Go, I'm a very casual VR user, and I've been taking more and more 360 video since getting my Gear 360. Often I want to view this content in bed, on the couch, etc. where there are kinda constraints on moving around enough to see from any perspective. I say ""kinda"" because of course I \*could\* get up and move around, I just don't wanna, it's more effort than I want to expend.

The same thing would occur if you wanted to use the headset in an airplane seat. I imagine you'd have less than 180 degrees of head movement, you could become a pain to your seat neighbors pretty quickly. For a lot of casual content, even some games (i.e. Eclipse, Monument Valley), being able to control the perspective from the controller would be nice.

It's surprised me that almost no apps (that I've encountered so far) allow perspective change like this from the controller also.

What would be REALLY nice is some way at the system level of the Go to enable this sort of override for any/all content. This has to exist already, right? If a physically impaired user wants to use a headset, granted the immersion will suffer a bit, but this seems like a perfectly acceptable tweak to the navigation model.

oculus,Recent Oculus Rift S Experience,"Hi everyone. I recently got a rift s as part of the black friday sale and wanted to share my experience, mainly for anyone looking to buy the rift s.

Short version is that my first headset was quite simply, defective. The cable connection at the headset was extremely finicky and if you turned slightly it would disconnect. I plugged it back in multiple times, tried different display ports, different USB ports, even a powered USB hub, nothing worked. I also had the issue where my headset would occasionally stop tracking my hands and they would lock in place.

So after many hours troubleshooting, I returned it and ordered another. Got it today and works awesome! No issues setting up or with tracking, no black outs/ shutting off, and the connection to the headset is firm.

It's an absolute blast to get to play with a rift s that actually works lol. For anyone wondering, I play robo recall, Pavlov, and blade and sorcery.

oculus,(Rift S)Can we talk about this - Oculus Software Restart Required,"Many of you may have seen or heard about this issue, many others, like myself, may be one of the victims. If you have not heard about this issue, it is a problem that plagues primarily the Rift S from what I can tell. The problem seems to arise after a PC reboot after setting up the Rift S for the first time. When the Oculus Software starts, a notification appears on the Devices tab showing an issue with the Rift S. Clicking on the Rift S shows a message which says ""Oculus Software Restart Required"". Restarting all of the Oculus Software and services does not fix this message no matter how many times it is done, and the headset is unusable when in this state (black screen).

A quick Google search for Oculus Rift S Software Restart Required will reveal dozens of posts on various forums detailing this issue dating all the way back to late March and early June, right around the Rift S release. All of the many posts I've seen are filled with conjecture, hypotheses, and mundane troubleshooting steps which leave users in no better shape and no real answers. Some think it's due to USB driver versions, some think it's a power draw issue, some think it's an Oculus Software bug (my opinion), others think it's due to outdated graphics drivers or windows updates, but no one really knows. This issue has been affecting many users since launch, and the lack of any official statement by Oculus is concerning to say the least.

I'd like to hear from those of you who may have experienced this problem. If you created an Oculus Support ticket, what was the provided solution? Did the provided solution fix the issue? Did you try any troubleshooting yourself? Did any of those steps fix the issue? When did you start experiencing this, and what are the symptoms?

This would open the VR market to basically anyone with a pc and willing to buy a heaset (if you get a wmr heaset that’s only £200 to get into VR). If oculus or other company were able to get the developers on board, then you would be able to play the whole library of quest games, on limited pc power, and with an ecosystem mostly built.

For the record, I love gun controllers for games. I have the PS Sharpshooter for PS3 (Killzone 3 is fantastic with it). I even have a MAG II gun for PC and I experimented with wiimotes https://youtu.be/8OcXppjEgi8 and https://youtu.be/GyYm1s6y4RY. I got the PS4 Pro and the PSVR mainly for the aim controller. For VR I have the standard ProTube.

First some thoughts on PSVR and Farpoint. What can I say, apart from the fixed IPD (blurry edges with my 70mm IPD), having those early-game spidery things in Farpoint jump at me in a headcrab-like arc really gave me a chill down the spine. I have not felt that recently. And splashing them mid-air with the aim controller was such fun! For some reason, the robotic spiders in Robo Recall do not elicit the same primal reaction.

The haptics on the aim controller are quite good and really bring that feeling of actually holding and shooting a gun. Unfortunately, with the ProTube I get almost no haptics. The vibrations of the Touch controllers are very, very weak and they are even less noticeable when the touch controllers are in the ProTube cups.

So I have a question: does the ForceTube work well? Does it work in all games? How does it compare to other controllers like the PSVR aim controller and the PS Sharpshooter?",1575618283.0,1,0,196789

oculus,CV1 to Rift S - First Impressions,"I have tried the Rift S before briefly, and wasn’t sure about the comfort, but my wife got me one for Black Friday, so here are my impressions.  I am a 67-68 IPD

Also, to qualify this, I last used my Rift CV1 a couple days ago and won’t be able to use it again until next week (for reasons) so I can’t compare them directly.

Visual Quality

Awesome.  Huge improvement over the CV1.  The SDE is still there, but vastly improved and often not noticeable.  I thought the colors were just fine despite it not being an OLED.  I didn’t try it in Elite Dangerous or another super dark game though.  Clarity around the screen was great too.  Couldn’t get both eyes 100% focused but seemed clear when using it.  It did seem very slightly off though, hard to explain, I think because my IPD is too wide?  Not enough to notice 90% of the time, the the visuals were a huge bump up.
As for God Rays, they are massively reduced.  You can still see streaks of light from high contrast objects, but they are much fainter and softer, just a slight smear of light.

Comfort

The halo was comfortable once I got it set up.  The only drawback was it seemed like it took a lot more fiddling with it when I put it on.  The CV1 I could just slip on.

Tracking

Amazing.  I was expecting a slight downgrade from the CV1, but honestly it seemed as good or better.  I was sword fighting in Until You Fall (unrelated note, every one in awhile that game pauses with the hourglass figure, anyone know how to fix that?) and had zero problems.  Same with Robo Recall.  The setup was simple too.  

Audio

Ok, this is a downgrade.  Not as bad as I  feared (my previous demo was in a noisy store so couldn't tell then) but it is still a downgrade.  Not horrible though, you can still hear clearly.

Eye Strain

In a previous post I mentioned that I felt the Rift S caused some eye strain for me when I demoed it.  I spent some time trying different fittings to reduce that.  But after playing awhile, I am still feeling it.  I didn’t have this problem with the CV1.  I think it is just the price I will have to pay for a wider IPD.

I will update this next week after I have had more time to play and have my CV1 hooked up again to compare side by side.

Update 1 - I was asked about blurriness at the edges of the lens.  I don't think it is bad.  I mean yes it gets distorted when you look at the far edge of the lense, but it has a big sweet spot where it is very clear to look around with your eyes.",1575570028.0,9,21,196789

oculus,Is Oculus Quest supposed to hurt?,"Just got an Oculus Quest. It seems way more uncomfortable than I expected. Particularly in the area right under my eye/high cheek area.

oculus,Rift S - Need for cover / VR Cover use?,"Hello,

Like many, I recently got an Oculus Rift S on black friday, and trying to be a perfectionist about it looked for accessories for it. I was disappointed to see that there weren't a lot of options on the market. I ordered the AMVR grips, which I will hopefully not regret (I barely saw other options here either), but the one thing I heard people talking about is that you should use a washable cover for the Rift S due to hygiene reasons. On further research I have seen that the one offered by VR Cover (which I heard was the best for these kind of things) for the Rift S was just a simple cloth you strap over. 

&amp;#x200B;

For the price it costs, it would cost just as much to just get a replacement headplate for the Rift S in case I needed one - and the VR Cover one also has basically no reviews to be found anywhere online. So I'm asking here: Anyone with experience - is the VR Cover worth it and are there better alternatives or other must-have accessories to further improve the care of my new (and first) VR headset.

 In the few games it's there, but easily ignore able unless I focus on it. .  Is this just something that sometimes happens or something I can correct by changing a setting? 

It's a minor distraction, and honestly if happened on both sides I would probably assume it's just a refresh issue and move on. Since it's only happening in one eye though, I thought it might be something I'm doing or a hardware issue.

oculus,Day One with Rift S. :),"Well, today I finally, after waiting like 5 years to get a headset, got the Rift S.

I also got the Sapphire Nitro+ 5700XT.

I've only used the headset for a few hours, around 6, and everything seems to be working great.

I played First Step, it has you push buttons on the controller, but there is a long delay between each scripted event, it kept making me think the thing had froze.  The desk comes out of the floor, and you have cubes to play with. Throw a paper airplane, and play with ping pong paddle and ball.

Then I noticed that it was awfully quiet, there was no sound. So I wanted to take the headset off, and decided to put the controllers on the desk in front of me, till I remember it wasn't real. LOL! Almost dropped them on the floor! Yikes!

The little flying robot felt like he was there, like I could reach out and touch him! Very cool!

When I first put the headset on, I was sitting down, and I started the wrong game, I meant First Step, but played the next one after that one. The floor was wrong, and I was up near the ceiling. I wanted to stand up, and get in place in my room, but there was equipment around my head, and it seemed so real, that my brain was telling me not to stand up, your going to smash your face into that. LOL!!! Unreal!

Anyway, after I took a break for food, and looked up some info, and then installed Steam VR. Very easy to do.

I had bought Space Pirate Trainer, a game I've been wanting to play for years now. :) Took all of about 2 mins to install Steam VR, and Space Pirate Trainer, and I was playing. Very smooth. I had less trouble with Steam, than Home. In Home, I couldn't find a way to recenter my view, so I had to face odd directions to play. Steam, made it very easy. 

Great game, the tracking is awesome. The guns in my hand seemed real, because they followed my every movement, as fast as I was moving them. I was holding the shield with the controller like under my chin, hiding behind the shield, and never lost tracking, I never lost tracking since I got the headset for that matter! :) Oh, and I played the whole time lying on my back!! :) I was tired, long day. :) Worked great though.

Then I used the Virtual Desktop in Home to watch a YouTube video. I made the screen huge. Video quality was great, like no screen door effect at all. Much better than I thought. I honestly never read anyone say how good the picture was, they always seemed disappointed.... After seeing it for myself, I don't understand their reaction.

People complain about the blacks, and the sound. The blacks are black enough, they aren't perfect, but very far from being a game breaker, and the sound is good, nice 3D Spatial audio, no you don't get hard bass, but you get a bit, I can live with it.

Zero motion sickness. I'm farsighted, and had zero trouble seeing with the Rift S. My eyes never got tired.

Computer Stats:
950watt Power supply, was running two GTX 480's, that's what I just upgraded from. :)
3770K CPU
Sapphire Nitro+ 5700XT 3 times faster than my 480's. :)
32gigs of ram
Inateck Superspeed 7 Ports PCI-E to USB 3.0 Expansion Card KT5002 using the far left port, if you're facing the back of your computer.

Make sure you usb ports power save is disabled. I had done it, but for some reason, it turned back on. Which caused the screen to go black, I had put the headset down for a few minutes, and wouldn't wake up when I put the headset back on. Had to reboot, this happened a couple of times, after that I rechecked those settings, and had to turn them off again....

Question, how do you watch a video, without hearing the crackling fire in Oculus Home the whole time?

So far, the Rift S has been great. Hopefully it remains that way. Need to get some sleep. :) Long day of VR tomorrow. :)",1575525830.0,24,22,196790

## Project Elysium #announcementsSERVERToday at 9:40 PM

The development team has successfully moved to the USA. After company registration, we had to create a new Steam profile for our company. The game is going to be pulled off the old account and uploaded there. A bit of an administrative workaround but we're looking forward to the future!  The old (Russia registered) account and Steam page will no longer be active. The new Steam page is going be available as soon as it finished. We will post another announcement by that time.  Oh and here's another screenshot cause why not.

Could it be because of that or is it just me not being used to wearing VR headset for longer sesions?

Basically new condition  and all in OG box with sensors and everything. I can also try it and  test before I had over the money for it.

oculus,"Best options for headset, Oculus Rift S","Alright so, I've been getting into VRChat pretty heavy recently, been having a good time. What's not a good time is every time I meet someone new they bitch and moan about my audio quality from the mic, and how it intermittently ""roboticizes"" and is just generally poor quality and makes unpleasant noises on its own accord. This has been ruining my experiences. So, since I'm also looking to supplement the also very poor speakers of the rift S, which honestly at this point are less of a bother than the even poorer mic, I figured the best way to do that is to buy a wireless combo headset. With that said, i tried the ps4 ones that my brother had and they were super loose and did not cup the ears well and wanted to fall off anytime I was playing something active. So, what have people had good luck with. I'm looking for something that foremost, snugly holds the ears and has good audio quality, as well as good mic quality. Now that I think about it, battery life is a big one too. I have been known to play for up to 6-7 hours at a time now that I have gotten my VR legs so it would be nice to not go mute halfway through. I do believe with the rift s the only way to achieve this is wireless since they didn't implement a mic input, so I suppose that's a necessity too.

oculus,CV1 to Quest (PC) first impressions [Technical and experience],"So having just gotten an Oculus Quest after a few months with a dead launch-day OG Rift I'm thrilled to be joining the virtual worlds again, also bare in mind that until my 3m Usb-C cable gets here in a few days I was using a 0.5m cable.

Setup was really easy. On my AMD R9 3900x system which uses an AMD Radeon 5700XT GPU and Gigabyte X570 ITX motherboard there were absolutely no problems whatsoever, it's simply one cable with no dicking about with sensors or the convoluted setup process. I had no issues getting the headset connected and it booted right into Home without any complaints or hickups. Here are the first things I noticed visually...   
   
The **field of view**, it is FAR less boxy and much to my surprise it is noticably **wider** than my OG Rift, I had heard mixed reports of this with some saying the field of view felt narrower, well I can confirm that this isn't the case and I can see more both horizontally and vertically, this is the first thing I noticed and I had tested this by standing on the balcony of my Home and looking out over the mountains (something I did a lot) and immediately it felt like I could both see more, and further - it's a noticable upgrade!   
   
Next were the **colours**, all colors seemed brighter with darker shades being far more uniform and 'black' than on my OG Rift, there were no tints or maura artefacts. Everything felt more alive, I can see any games based in space are going to be a real treat to play on this!   
   
Now onto **resolution**, I was expecting the edges to have that wierd pixelation effect you often see in screenshots from Quest games, I did not see any of this, I looked hard for compression artefacts and could find none (I spent a good hour trying to pick them out, I could not), the resolution is noticably higher than on the OG Rift most likely helped by the higher resolution panels inside the headset, while the screen-door effect is still present if you look for it, it is a big improvement over the OG Rift, I noticed I could see the photos I have imported onto my wall much clearer from further away and could pick out details easily.   

The **lenses** are a big improvement over the OG Rift, there is still some god-rays but they seem far less distracting and the sweet-spot is much bigger, I can look to the edges and still easily read text and pick out details, the lenses seem larger and set further back meaning that someone with glasses will have an easier time using this headset.  

**Tracking** definetly feels 'better', the blind spots are 'static' and relative to me, rather than having to 'guess' where they are due to the placement of the sensors. The controllers worked just fine while waving them around like a muppit and even moving them out of my sightline didn't seem to cause them to drop out.

Finally comfort, I used to find the OG rift not that comfortable after an hour of usage and would get ""Rift face"", I personally actually find the Quest to be more comfortable than the OG Rift here.

tl;dr: It's better in every way than the OG Rift with the added bonus of being able to take it with you and hop into VR on the go",1575492049.0,18,33,196789

I've never had the chance to try VR, all VR demo's are far away and I don't know anyone with it.

The only thing I can't do is run this on a different machine, as I only have one VR ready computer. I've tried installing this thing several times and nothing is successful. I'm getting pretty frustrated. I'm also finding that a lot of the information is some what old (dating back to May). So I'm curious as to how this issue hasn't been fixed.

oculus,Is my PC good enough for VR?,"So I know there's different system requirements that certain games have, but I just wanted individual opinions based on your experiences, whether or not my PC would provide an enjoyable experience for me with most VR games. I'm about to get an Oculus Rift S, and these are my system specs:

* Ryzen 5 1600 oc to 3.9 Ghz
* PowerColor RedDevil RX 580 8GB
* 16GB DDR4-3200 RAM
* Gigabyte B450 DS3H mobo
* 1 TB HDD (no ssd :( )

Games that I'm looking into playing would be Skyrim VR; Hot dogs, horseshoes, &amp; hand grenades; Blade and Sorcery; and possibly Boneworks when it comes out. If I could work on it, what would be the best upgrades? I have about $300 budget to work with if need be, and fortunately I've got a microcenter near me with deals for ryzen processors. Such as:

* Ryzen 7 2700X for $160
* Ryzen 5 2600X for $120

oculus,Got a Rift S the other day...,"...after selling my CV1 a few months back. I haven't really messed with VR (other than PSVR) in about a year and a half, but I figured the upgrade was just what I needed to revitalize my interest. And so far I really like the comfort and increased clarity in this one. Plus I have a tiny room space, so not having to screw with cameras is really nice. I got back into The Climb tonight and had a blast. A gloriously exhausting blast.

oculus,Rift S impressions from a CV1/DK2 user’s perspective,"When the Rift S was announced I admit I was a bit meh about it. The resolution bump and longer cable looked nice, but losing OLED and the rather nice audio solution of the CV1 just didn’t seem worth it. But then of course Black Friday took £50 off the price and it seemed like the right time to dive in and see how it is.

First impressions out of the box were mixed. The headset itself definitely feels high quality. The materials used are very good, especially the plush cushion on the inside of the halo. It just seemed a bit bulky compared to the CV1 thanks to the halo. I expected it to be much heavier than it was when I lifted it out of the box. Likewise the new controllers are a big improvement in materials, they feel fantastic in your hand.

The setup experience was a bit of a pain for no reason I could see. The mandatory headset firmware upgrade seemed like it had stuck and spent a worrying amount of time just sitting there doing not very much. There definitely needs to be better feedback to the user while that’s going on. And then I got the dreaded sensors can’t track error. Unplugging and replugging the USB cable as suggested had no effect, but a quick reboot seemed to do the trick.

Popping the headset on for the first time I was hugely surprised at just how comfortable and easy to secure it is. There’s no pressure on your face at all, the weight seems perfectly evenly distributed by the halo. Once secured it doesn’t wiggle or move about.

&amp;nbsp;

As soon as the screens activated the improvements over the CV1 display were evident. I was hugely sceptical of the claims of vastly reduced/no screen door but it’s absolutely true. If anything it feels like a bigger leap than going from DK2 to CV1 did. I had to keep my head absolutely still and really hunt for signs of pixels. It’s a huge improvement because everything looks and feels far more solid and much less like you’re looking through a mesh at a screen. God rays are indeed hugely reduced or eliminated. I noticed some shimmer around white text on a black background on a Wolves in the Walls loading screen, but nothing anywhere else.

Text on the Oculus UI is crystal clear, and Virtual Desktop is a joy. The ‘sweet spot’ is definitely far bigger and you can really look around with your eyes to see stuff clearly without having to move your head to get things legible. Watching videos with the reduced screen door and better pixel density  is a far more enjoyable experience, whether in Virtual Desktop, Big Screen or 3D SBS/180 content.

Firing up Elite Dangerous and DCS it was clear that legibility of text and instruments is vastly better, Especially in DCS. The inky not-quite-black of space (I never messed with SPUD) is still there but it looks significantly smoother with less obvious blocky gradients. Colours are great, contrast is not noticeably any worse than CV1 and it all looks superb. I haven’t noticed any detriment to the step down to 80hz refresh rate.

&amp;nbsp;

Which was when I realised that the tracking was just working perfectly. I’d not really thought about it, but the inside-out tracking does indeed work as advertised. In the few hours I’ve spent in the headset I’ve had no issues at all, even in a poorly lit room with a flashing Christmas tree at the other end. If I hadn’t known better I’d not have been able to tell it apart from the CV1 tracking set up, except now I have more bits of my room I can use as I can go in part of the room that I couldn’t cover with sensors before.

&amp;nbsp;

So audio. This surprised me. It’s actually really nice not to have anything on your ears and the sound is really not bad. It’s not great, but it’s spacious and very natural, even if it does lack bass. Sadly I’ll rarely get to use it that way as my PC is in the living/dining room and even on CV1 I was always getting told to turn it down. And that’s where the headphone jack really shines, because I can finally fully isolate the outside world from my VR audio. What I haven’t settled on is which headphones are best to use. My ATH-M50x headset fits over the halo, just, but it all gets a bit painful if I want to just slip the headset off quickly. Some AKG in-ear buds worked much better in practical terms, but at the cost of losing the spacious nature of the sound. In the end I’m a bit torn on this and I’m not sure if I’d rather have the CV1 audio solution back or not.

&amp;nbsp;

The other big addition which I was a bit meh about initially was pass through. It just didn’t seem to offer that much practical value. Until I realised that it automatically activates if you put your head through the guardian boundary. And that is really cool. It is quite handy to be able to double-click the oculus button and activate to check where you are without having to try and squint through the reduced (but not eliminated) nose gap.

That Oculus button on the right remote though. That needs a rethink. I know I’ll get used to it but I must have accidentally hit it at least five or six times and it’s just a nuisance.

&amp;nbsp;

So how do I feel about it overall? I think it’s pretty great. The downsides aren’t nearly as down as they might seem on  paper, and the improvements in the screen and lenses over the CV1 are spectacular. Virtual worlds now feel far more solid and substantial, and the extra comfort of the halo design means I can spend much longer enjoying them. I may even have re-kindled my love of VR all over again, which I genuinely didn’t expect.",1575455760.0,51,43,196789

oculus,"""Headset Sensor Tracking"" stuck for my new Oculus Rift S, haven't heard back from Oculus support and hoping you guys have other ideas on how I can fix this problem so I don't have to return my headset","**""Headset Sensor Tracking""** is the problem spot I can't get past.

So I unboxed it Sunday and had some difficulty getting started. Oculus software installed just fine, so I started the setup. I thought I had to have everything plugged in before I got there, so after it wouldn't connect I disconnected, restarted and tried again. After quite some time, the setup finally got past ""Headset Sensor Tracking"" and I was able to hook up the touch controllers and play.

It wasn't perfect, but it worked for a few hours Sunday night. I did the tutorial with the robot in the trailer, played around in Home, then figured out how to play Elite Dangerous. I didn't know you could hold down the Oculus button to reset the look in front of you, so I messed around with redrawing the guardian boundary so I could sit in my desk chair and play with it in front of me (knowing about the buttons now makes that 20 minutes of futzing with the boundary funny). Played it for about 20 minutes before bed (it took me several hours to get it going) and stopped.

The next day, I couldn't get it to read. I've got [my logs through last night here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1K-tI-jjVi4OKT8785p1TV4Fc3mvdL8UQ/view?usp=sharing), and it looks like the USB port isn't reading the headset. So I tried a number of things:

* *Change Advanced Power Settings*: **Disabled** USB selective suspend setting
* *Device Manager &gt; USB Controllers &gt; R-Click* ‘**Rift S USB Hub**’ and unchecked  ‘Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power’
* *Tried every USB port:* I have tried plugging the USB into every port I have on the machine, including the 2.0 slots. Every time, I unplug the Display Port cable and plug it back in 10-20 seconds after plugging in the USB.
* *Tried plugging in minimal other cables*: I read that it may not draw enough power if other stuff is plugged in with it. Didn't work when it was only cable plugged in any of the 6 USB ports.
* *Tried reseating the headset cable*: it was plugged in strongly before, but I reseated the cable and made sure to be careful plugging it back in.
* *Updated Windows 10*: No change
* *Updated drivers for GPU, MoBo, CPU:* No change
* *Uninstalled and reinstalled Oculus software*: No change

I have tried some other things, but they aren't coming to mind right now as I sit at work. I did order [this PCIe card](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00B6ZCNGM/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) on Monday night, but that isn't going to arrive at my house until Friday. Judging by the log, I'm guessing it's got to be that the USB ports on my MoBo aren't getting enough power to the headset, but the *audio* works perfectly fine - I've left the headset plugged in after trying to connect, and then played some Final Fantasy XI only to hear the audio coming from the headset.

If anyone has any ideas, I'll include my PCPartPicker parts list to show all the stuff in it.

Pressing menu + Y takes way longer than it should to make the light blink. It tries for 30 seconds or so before saying ""unable to pair"". It then disconnects the headset via USB 3 cable (though the cable itself stays connected) and the controller flashes fast in an S.O.S. style for minutes afterward. The headset cannot find the controller afterwards.

I have attempted disconnecting all other USB devices, running the driver through the support tab (which fixed another issue I had), and reconnecting both cables as the controller pairs. I have double checked the batteries as well.

Some things to note: Yesterday the headset made a quiet hissing/coil whine noise, which has since stopped (I read that was normal until guardian was set up but I haven't gotten that far).

oculus,Brass Tactics and The Unspoken are freakin amazing!,"So, after 6 months absolutely loving my Quest, and drooling over the expansive library of PCVR games, I finally just got a pc to use with a Link. There have been a few games particularly that I’ve had my eye on which really helped push me over the edge on buying the PC.

Now, finally, after months of watching gameplay videos and reviews I finally have them (well almost all of them) and let me just say I am not disappointed!

Brass Tactics is just the most accessible, intuitive and downright fun game, such a refreshing change of pace from all the pew pew. Don’t get me wrong, I love a good shooter, but I like to have a diverse library that covers a bunch of different gaming moods, and this fills a massive hole in my VR experience. If you’re on the fence on this one then I strongly recommend you try the free “Arena” version. 

The Unspoken is similar, in that it offers something different from a lot of other games, and what it offers is an absolute blast! Admittedly, I’ve only just got it and played through about an hour of the story mode, so I can’t comment on AI opponents or multiplayer, but what I’ve played so far has made me grin from ear to ear. I can’t wait to unlock all the different character classes, skill up and head into battle. So much fun!

Next on my list is In Death and Arizona Sunshine, but I want to take my time with these two before I jump to the next ones.

For all the new to PCVR people out there, what are the games that are blowing your minds? And to all the veterans, what are the games that you think the noobs should be rushing to get?",1575451782.0,27,32,196791
oculus,Is PCVR worth the jump.,I had no experience with VR until 2 weeks ago I bought myself a oculus quest. I love it since buying I have not touched my PS4 pro or Xbox One X I have just played my quest. I only have 3 real gripes with my quest one is the graphics. Although they are not terrible I want the most visually stunning VR experience. However in order to get that I would need to invest in a valve index rift s or vice pro. My second complaint is a lot of the VR seem like 1-3 hour experiences and I come from playing 50 hour open world campaign style games. Lastly is the game library although it has options it’s limited compared to the options I would have on PC. I have been considering building a PC for a while and now I’m thinking this might be the time with VR. However my question is for anyone that has PCVR is it a groundbreaking experience coming from a quest? My only fear is I spend 4-6k in building a gaming PC monitors desk chair upgrading my VR system and it’s just only a slight or not a huge 1000s of dollar better upgrade.

oculus,"Getting the best performance to visual compromise, No Man's Sky VR, simple guide","I wrote this as a comment in another thread but I thought people may like to see it, and I was playing some more today after tinkering a lot the other day with settings, and was feeling confident about my suggestion.

With the various patches to NMS VR, a lot of the ideas put forward in older guides soon after the VR release aren't as applicable. I don't have the technical knowledge to tell you what kinds of little things you can try to squeeze the most juice out of your computer when playing NMS VR, but I did do a bunch of experimenting and determined what graphical settings should be prioritised for the best aesthetic, immersive experience imHo.

This guide is only effective for computers above a certain threshhold of power. Mine is an RTX 2070.

The short of it: prioritise super sampling over in-game graphical setting improvements. To a point. 

The in-game settings I will provide are based off testing where I feel these settings provide the most impact for the least resources. Further increases don't create substantial aesthetic benefit, but further downgrades result in pretty big negative aesthetic result. The guide starts with these settings, no more, no less, follow them exactly (if your computer can't run these settings at regular 1x resolution then I would ignore this guide T_T):

**Texture Quality**: High

**Animation Quality**: Ultra (depends on your CPU, because this setting uses CPU only)

**Shadow Quality**: Enhanced

**Post Processing**: High

**Volumetric Effects**: Standard

**Terrain Tesselation**: Standard (off)

**Planet Quality**: Standard

**Base Qaulity**: ...I haven't spent time around bases yet, so I'm not sure. I have it set to High for now.

**Anisotropic Filtering**: 2

**Anti Aliasing**: Off/none

**GBAO**: Off

Okay, in-game settings done.

**Go to Steam VR settings. Check the box to disable ASW (in the ""Applications"" tab).**

**After that, also in the Applications tab, just adjust your Super sampling as high as you can without losing that solid framerate (you want your game staying in the green of that little live display of your refresh rate).** If you can go higher than 200%, I'd stop there and start bumping graphics settings again.

But damn, 200% is beautiful. I can't run it at 80fps with 2x on my setup, but I tried it for a bit just to see and it's gorgeous. The super sampling makes a much bigger difference in NMS than any of those graphical settings past what I listed, imo.

On my system if I want to achieve 80fps I have to stick closer to 100% resolution. :'( I'm in the process of deciding whether I'd rather run smooth at 80fps or keep the super sampling nice and high and suffer the consequences...

If your computer can't handle those baseline in-game graphic settings, I would lower the graphics settings before lowering resolution below 100%. Shit gets rough. A big part of No Man's Sky is that beauty, and at some point that gets lost amidst the noise when the resolution isn't high enough.

If you do reach 200% at a comfortable, stable fps, imo the first thing you would want to increase after that is Anisotropic filtering. Anywhere up to and including the max 16. before prioritising something else. This will get everything just a little crisper and more detailed from a distance, which again I feel is one of the more impactful aesthetic changes you can make in NMS VR. Turning on something like Terrain Tesselation or GBAO is nice, but rather than being an aesthetic improvement, I feel that it's more of an aesthetic DIFFERENCE. So unless you're REALLY attached to the look of one of those, you don't really lose anything turning them off, and I wouldn't prioritise them (they seem to take up a lot of resources I think).

Hope that helps some people enjoy it!",1575430399.0,48,21,196791

For some reason it doesn't influence Oculus home that much, but when you run a game, even natively like Space Pirate Trainer or Catan VR you can notice it.

oculus,Rift S review after 6 months,"I purchased my first VR headset (Rift S) this summer and it has mostly been a blast. I've introduced family members and friends to VR, which has probably been the best part of the experience for me. Watching them pop into First Steps/Contact and Beat Saber for the first time has probably been one of the best gaming experiences of my life. I've finally been able to bond over games with the people in my life who don't normally play games at all. My girlfriend and I have put in a ton of hours on Beat Saber, the game is great and the mod community makes it amazing. Normally I have no interest in rhythm games but this one has definitely been the exception. I've also had a bit of fun with the archery range in The Lab, Superhot VR, and the lightsaber dojo in Vader Immortal.

All those nice things said, I really wish I could get more out of my VR experience and play some more intense games. Sadly, every time I've tried I've ended up regretting it. I've attempted a number of others (mostly Lone Echo, Pavlov VR, Onward, Blade &amp; Sorcery). I've got plenty of others in my library to try as well since I purchased the summer sale game packs on both the Oculus store and on Steam.

What's preventing me from wanting to even try is motion sickness (or virtual reality sickness, which I suppose is more accurately the lack of motion, confusing the brain). I've tried a lot of advice mentioned here. Marijuana, ginger tea, frequent breaks, slowly working my way up and trying to build a resistance. I'm always done by my first break. I start feeling it as soon as I load into these games. My IPD is slightly above the recommendation for the Rift S (69) but I don't think that's too impactful. And it's not just me, everyone whom I've had test my headset while playing a game with movement/""moderate comfort"" level has reported the same feelings of dizziness and nausea. This really makes me wonder what people are talking about on the sub when they claim to have overcome these problems, or never had them to begin with. I've only extensively tested it on myself, but I've yet to meet anyone who doesn't experience nausea or claim it doesn't bother them.

Because of this, I've preferred to stick to my 2D world of gaming and declare my VR headset a $400 Beat Saber machine, and nifty toy for social gatherings. While I did really enjoy my short play sessions of other games in the moment, it's just not worth the horrible regret afterward.",1575447057.0,10,56,196791

My quest arrived last night and I'm pretty impressed. Tried a couple of native demos and it reminds me of WII games. In a good way, that the sheer fun and immersion makes me forget the simple cartoony graphics. Why waste money on graphics cards when its this good.

Oh yeah.

I want to play PC games. So, after a bit of messing about I finally managed to get the only VR PC game I own running. Dirt Rally 2.0.

But knowing the Quest was coming I bought Elite in the Steam sale (I already have it on Commodore 64, Atari ST and PS4!). When looking into how to get Dirt Rally running (I thought that as it has an Oculus mode I just selected that) I found a lot of complaints about the steam version not supporting Oculus API and wonder if this is a real issue.

Should I refund Steam Elite while I can and pay 4x the price for the Oculus version? What about future games? Should I buy from the Oculus store where possible?

oculus,Audio problems with the CV1,"I've got my rift second hand like 2 weeks ago, tested it at the guy's house and it was fine (the only problem was that there was a piece of wire connecting the ground pins of the earpieces, which is a relatively common fix for loss of hearing in the left ear)

At home I played games like gorn and budget cuts where audio doesn't really matter and was having a blast, then when I got Beat Saber I was shocked by how truly terrible the audio was, basically unplayable. I've tried reattaching th earpieces etc. and checking drivers but that doesn't appear to help. 

An interesting thing is that if I'm not the headset and am playing sound through the speakers it sounds fine, but when I put it on some contact must get disconnected or something because it just craps out again. I now play beat Saber with my wired gaming headset using a USB extension cord which, to say the least, isn't ideal.

The biggest ""downgrade"" is the far distance scenery surrounding you. It's essentially a medium quality ""image"" wrapped around the level. It's still pretty and relaxing to look at the surrounding distance however.

Also you can tell that the lighting is ""baked"" into the rocks/mountains you are climbing. Other than that it doesn't look any different to me that my brain can remember from playing it in 2016. 

The cooling fan they included on the Quest has done wonders to keep the processor cool - it really helps them push this hardware quite hard.

oculus,PSA: Why You probably SHOULDN'T buy a used CV1 off eBay,"So we all know about the CV1 cable kerfuffle, being on this subreddit it's impossible to miss because there are almost daily threads complaining about it. That isn't what this post is about, but for those who are living under a tin foil covered rock Oculus has stopped making the HDMI/USB cable that connects the headset to your PC, meaning you're stuck paying $120+ on eBay if yours happens to break.

Recently, I've noticed CV1s are going stupid cheap on eBay, like $150-200 cheap, and on the surface it seems like a great value. The CV1 has excellent tracking, great controllers, and at that price it seems like an absolute bargain, and if you're mindful about the cable you should be able to stretch it to a year or so and hopefully by that point there will be some kind of solution to the cable issue or other replacement VR hardware would be available or cheaper. No, the issue is with the actual headset condition itself.

The reason for the price drop is pretty simple: old Rift users are nervous about the state of the platform, and are trying to sell off their current hardware to help fund an upgrade to a Rift S or Index. This alone isn't an issue, thats just how markets work, but what *is* an issue is the large number of users misrepresenting their heavily used headset's condition trying to play off consumer ignorance. My friend just fell for one of these, and purchased a set that was described as in ""very good condition"" and that there was ""nothing wrong with it"". Then he got it and immediately asked if the headset [cable was supposed to look like this](https://i.imgur.com/W1eWGtU.jpg). Honest to god this thing has one of the worst cables I've seen, [and it's a small wonder it still works](https://i.imgur.com/s0omLs3.jpg). The shielding is crinkled and bent due to constant prolonged twisting, and is flat out broken in a couple of places where there are tight knots. I'm pretty sure if you remove the knot the cable will just fail. It's quite obvious that the seller knew this thing was nearing its end and passed it off while it still somewhat worked.

Just taking a quick look and there are more issues that can be pretty hard to spot in listings that I've rarely seen disclosed, such as scratched lenses, broken audio ribbon cables, cracked controllers (I've seen some clever camera angles), and missing sensor stands. I'm not saying all of them are bad, and I bet a lot are in great shape (some people on this sub have had good luck I know), but it's really hard to spot ones that are bad and there is a significant chance you get ""one of the bad ones"".

The thing with this is, eBay takes their post descriptions rather seriously (otherwise literally nobody would shop there), and is *incredibly* buyer-biased when dealing with issues like this. If eBay feels that the seller was being misleading in a small way, they usually side with the buyer (this is why you want to avoid sweeping claims like ""nothing wrong with it"" in your description when selling less than perfect items, as it pretty much always will bite you in the ass). Chances are he can get this sorted through eBay's support team, and if not he's just out the money he paid for the thing unless he wants to pay another $150 for the cable, as I doubt this thing will last more than a week of daily use.

So if you want to buy one just get one with the most detailed description, right? Well, that is a strategy, and will give you some help when going through ebay's buyer protection system, but honestly imo it's not worth it just so you don't have to go through the hassle of dealing with eBay scammers. If you are considering one, you can request more pictures of the lenses, accessories, and cable in the advert, which will help you not end up in this situation, although some photos (esp of lenses) won't be all that helpful.

If you're serious about wanting a Rift CV1 (I won't stop you, it's a great HMD), here are my tips. First, shop local on CL and FB Market. Then you can actually have a look and test what you're buying before dropping the money. If the seller is hesitant to let you do a test run with their computer equipment, then just walk. I seriously saw an ad from someone pretending that their computer didn't work with it and thats why they can't show you it works. Secondly, don't actually believe the sellers ""only used it for a week"" claims. Literally every single eBay and local ad I've seen always mentions how little they used it, and I wouldn't believe any of it. Finally, if you're still wanting to buy on eBay for the better buyer protection or due to a lack of local options, refer to the paragraph above and get as much info as possible before dropping the cash. You don't want to end up getting a damaged headset.

&amp;#x200B;

So yea, Tl;Dr there right now is a rush to get rid of CV1 hardware due to both its age and fear about the viability of it in the future, and this is leading to several worn out/partially damaged examples being sold as fully working units by people looking to get out. All it takes is to be an informed buyer, and remember to not settle for damaged hardware when you don't have to, but know you might have to if you are unlucky. Shopping local will probably be cheaper and give you a better result. 

Finally, if you are planning to sell your CV1, be as honest about it as possible and price it accordingly. I know it sucks that in a year your headset lost over 50% of its value, but misleading people like this hurts the growth of VR overall and especially on eBay there is a high chance it doesn't end well for you.

It really puts me off playing some VR titles as it just doesn't feel like my inputs are being translated correctly in game.",1575446536.0,0,6,196791
oculus,Stormland - World not resetting,"Anyone else has experienced only the timer reset but not the stats+escalation level?

By now there were 3 world resets:
- Nov 19
- Nov 26
- Dec 03 (Today)

I have completed terminus by Nov 19 and the world did not reset, only the timer countdown changed back to 7 days.
On the 26th, the second cycle did reset everything correctly and the escalation level went up.
Today the 3rd cycle did the same thing as the first by resetting only the timer. Everything else stayed the same, my stats, completed objectives and the map layout.

Am i missing something here?
Anyone else experiencing the same issue?

Without the world resetting correctly the game is not playable for another week, which completely breaks it.
The whole game relies heavily on this feature as the cycles are short, the objectives are the same and there is no other content. (Unless someone really enjoys flying around aimlessly collecting fruit and alloy)",1575413646.0,5,2,196791

That all being said, in the last couple of days when I’ve been trying to sleep or just chilling out still, I’ve felt, well, a little motion... not ‘sick’... just, like I’m moving when I’m not, it’s hard to really convey, it’s not a nice feeling and I’d say it almost feels light headed... I don’t 100% know if it’s a side effect of VRing or not.

Anyway, I was just wondering if anyone else gets this and if so, does it go away, like, if I stick to playing will my brain / body get used to this and then chill out with the weird moving when not moving (and totally not in VR) feelings?

oculus,Oculus Rift S Controllers Cause Headset Blackout. Assistance Would Be Greatly Appreciated!,"Good afternoon Reddit, I'm coming to you today for an interesting technical problem occurring with hopes that someone here may have encountered the same, and even more hopeful that someone may have a fix. I have submitted a ticket and chatted with three different support specialists who were all very helpful, however all of them stated that they had never heard of this before. From reading the many troubleshooting posts throughout the web I was very well prepared to work with support and had tried everything that they asked me to prior to contacting them. Below are the troubleshooting methods I attempted:

* Disabled power saving mode shutting off USBs
* Ensured all USB ports did not shut down for power via the device manager
* Re-seated the headset cable ensuring all pins were in tact, as well as unplugging re-plugging Display and USB
* Updated all drivers (graphics, device
* Re download and reinstall, with firewalls and AV disabled
* Repair tool
* 100% clean windows installation, discarding all files
* Switch between all available display ports and USB ports
* Other things that I cant recall as I worked on the issue for approximately 10 hours last night.

Listed below are the specs of my hardware and applicable software:

* MSI Z170 gaming MOBO
* EVGA GTX 1080 FTW
* I7 6700k
* 32 GB RAM
* 120 GB SSD (OS), 240 GB SSD, 1TB SSD
* 650w PSU (not sure if that might be the issue as its fairly low)
* Windows 10 Build 19033.1 (unable to revert to earlier build, or do not have the know how)

To further explain the issue, essentially what is happening is the Oculus Rift S headset when put on will emit a low white light then flicker to black. I then have to take it off and place it back on to replicate the issue. Somehow after hours of testing I found that if I take the batteries out of the controllers the setup menu and the room around me (via onboard cameras) is visible. As soon as I put one battery into the controller the screen goes black. This disallows me from actually going through the setup tutorial. When scanning the event logs the only thing that I can find is this error; "" Oculusdash.exe"" error. I cannot seem to find any other posts or information about this issue and support specialists stated that they have never seen this before. Again, any help with this would be greatly appreciated as this is my first potential VR experience. I just received the box yesterday and I am excited to join you all in the Oculus world. Thanks,

oculus,USB C to Displayport Adapter - Works but not sure how?,"So I have an Asus ROG Zephyrus GU502gv and just got the Rift S. Read some threads about if under the Nvidia Control Panel, under Configure PhysX, if the USB C port shows under the Intel discreet graphics, its tied to the CPU and not the GPU and shouldn't work. 

I ended up getting an a USB C Display-port Adapter and giving it a try anyways because the USB C port shows the DP logo next to it. Plugged everything in and IT WORKS, although with a little stutter. If I minimize the screen mirroring on the desktop the stutter isn't as bad. 

What my question is, is the Rift S running off of my RTX 2060 on the system, or is the CPU discreet graphics somehow rendering things? Tested the Rift S with the Oculus VR mini game, Beat Saber, and Job Simulator and it was pretty much the same, some stutter around the edges of the screen but would improve if I minimized the screen mirroring on my desktop.",1575411831.0,4,7,196791

oculus,Rift S with External Sensors,"Listen, I know this post is going to face immediate criticism and I know I’m going to get people commenting saying “it’s never going to happen, just deal with it”, but just please let me dream... 

I posted something similar around June and wanted to bring it back up because nothing more has been said about it. Look, the Rift S sensors are pretty dang good, but not perfect. They really struggle for me in FPS games where I’m covering up one hand sometimes and in games like Arena and even BeatSaber My hand will spas out at the end of a swing (I think I’m swinging too hard lol). We talked about this issue early in the Rift S release but heard little back from Oculus when we asked “would it be possible to ever use Rift CV1 sensors in conjunction with the Rift S headset”. But we did get one answer. “It is possible”. An answer to give us hope and shut us up for awhile. 

Here we are months and months later watching the quest get upgrade after upgrade to its software capabilities and we are left with the same ol’ headsets we bought at launch. People have been quoted saying “I’d be much more comfortable upgrading to the Rift S if I could keep using my sensors”. Look, Oculus, people are not sold on your product because it’s getting no love. Give us something. At least give me another “it’s possible” to give me hope for a few more months. 

-Sincerely, A hopeless Rift S Owner

Unlike cheaper models of the same laptop, it does not have a Thunderbolt port, only a USB type c gen2 connected to the GPU (Display Port Ready)

Tonight I tried to fire up the Oculus Rift S and...well, though I bought the exact adapter that was recommended to me by TyrielWood's video, the Display Port isn't finding anything connected.

&amp;#x200B;

A little more research, and I am being told it's because it's not a Thunderbolt port.

WUT? Why is this important? I'm baffled why a more expensive and higher spoecced laptop would have a USB type c Display Port connected to a GPU that is not Thunderbotl, thus rendering it completely incompatible with Rift S. Is this really the case?

I'm kind of devastated (This thing wasn't cheap and I do love it) and I know the Quest could work, but I am concerned with the heavier headset, the latency, and the lower refresh rate on the Quest using link.

I decided to take the task upon me off reconnecting my rift (cv1) in my new home.

Took 30-40 minutes to setup 3 sensors, since they have a specific combination of usb ports that they only works on.

Then, tried to install a new game. Well... oculus has this fun new message that says ""We think your antivirus is not letting us install the game"" to which, of course, the answer is ""I do not have any anti virus installed"". Well, the internet says, ""Whats the problem! Just download the oculus installation program and click 'Repair'! Whats the big deal!""

And so, 7.5 GB later, the screen finally changes, and now it says ""Well, that it didn't work for some reason we cant explain - go to our support page. Oh also, we already uninstalled your semi-working copy of the oculus app (that wasnt in the message it just FING HAPPENED)""

And... the cherry - oculus had this issue long back when it was only starting where you could only install its client on your C drive. Just some silliness that was cleared back in... never. Yup, oculus now needs more than 10GB (about 21 including the installation files it also insists on downloading to the C drive) and still THEY DEMAND YOU INSTALL IT IN YOUR C DRIVE. Hey, oculus, ever hear about how people buy small SSD drives to install windows on? 

They make it appear on their support site there is a way around this, but, you guessed it, there isnt. Because although you can pass them a ""drive"" argument, it only applies to the games you will download later, which you can ALREADY CHANGE FROM THE FING SETTINGS MENU ANYWAYS.

I hope one guy in charge of the PC client team sees this, and that I wasted at least a fraction of the time of his, as he did to me. How can a company be so far on the edge of technology, and so far back at the same time.

I got my Rift S yesterday, replacing my CV1. The CV1 used to fit my face perfect and was great, but the Rift S seems to drift, tilting down after minutes of play, skewing the image slightly. 

I’ve come to find out that it’s because I have weak ass cheekbones, and it doesn’t make contact with both above and below my eyes on my face, just above when in its optimal angle. This also introduces wobble to the entire display when moving. Tightening the straps / ratchet on the back only tighten the contact between my forehead and the back of my head, which only adds discomfort after a certain point and in no way solves my problem.

Last week I decided to by the rift s for medium and unity to continue my hobby of game design. So far I have had an great experience with the headset and the tracking doesn't bother me at all. In using the headset for uther things such as vr chat, echo, and other free platforms that include chats i started to hear cautionary tails about it. No one had a rift s that lasted more than five months! One man I met while playing echo said that he had gone through four headsets in three months explaining in detail how they broke each time and that the main cable is very delicate. Somebody else said that they had ended up switching to the quest and used the adapter because the adapter could be replaced.

oculus,Is my CV1 cable broken?,"    Greetings! I just bought a slightly used (according to the seller) Oculus Rift + Touch with 3 sensors. Everything looked good until I plugged in the HDMI and USBs. The USBs and Touch controllers work great, but the HDMI won't detect for some reason. I've tried everything everyone has said to do on the forums. Ensuring the cable is fully plugged in, unplugging and replugging, updating my drivers, reinstalling the software. No luck. 

     I'll explain more in depth. If I plug in the HDMI first, nothing happens; no lights, no nothing. If I plug in the connected USB first, I get one green check and a red light turns on in my headset. Then when I plug in the HDMI, the red light changes to either white or blue (I'm a bit colorblind), images go through my headset, and I can hear sound out of both headphones. For some reason I see the skyrim main screen. However, the HDMI still isn't recognized. I continue to setup my sensors but it doesn't change anything, the Oculus still says the HDMI is undetected.

     If anyone has any ideas or suggestions, it'd be much appreciated!

oculus,"Sex, Censorship, and Ethics in VR","Can Oculus ban you for watching porn?

The Oculus Code of Conduct says, ""*Do not: Use or promote sexually explicit content or conduct yourself in a sexually obscene or abusive way.*"" *""For repeated or egregious offenses, we may permanently disable your account.""*

Among consenting adults, sexual media, communication, and behavior is normal and healthy and is not equatable with abuse. Sexual expression is among the first uses of any communication technology from cave paintings to video chat. (*Rule 34 of the internet: If it exists, or can be imagined, there is internet porn of it.*) Furthermore, VR/AR promises to be a general purpose computing and collaboration technology. I can understand the desire to create safe spaces for certain audiences, and the desire to prevent abuse of all kinds, but the platform-wide banning of sex seems like a Black Mirror plot twist leading to a dystopic future.

It creates a ""suspected terrorist"" or ""drug war"" situation in which the vast majority of users knowingly break the code of conduct (which can be interpreted as a legal contract for many purposes) and are subject to de-platforming and exclusion for unstated reasons and zero legal recourse. Where purchased hardware can become ""bricked"" at the whim of the manufacturer. Censoring adult app developers from the Oculus Store prevents them from economically participating with a large audience of willing customers, and disincentivizes creative investment in the genre.

This topic also ties into the broader topic of private companies controlling public discourse without the public having recourse to amend these often secret and politically/socially motivated policies. Not to mention the idea that in the near future (or present?) black box AI algorithms may be controlling public discourse for motivations of their own without human oversight thus allowing our culture to be molded by powerful influence technologies with no broader understanding or appreciation of consequences.",1575416629.0,0,17,196791

A friend did a solution with a small wireless keyboard he had in his pocket to have access to text commands and special key binds. That works fine he says but me liking to take the harder and more complicated way thought I could have a USB Hub between the headset and battery.

I'm not very experienced when it comes to hardware so I'm asking here first: Would it be possible to run the OpenTPCast OS on a different system besides the TPCast module?
For example; Raspberry Pi is a Linux single board PC with integrated wireless card, four USBs and one HDMI port. I'm pretty sure the native TPCast module is stronger compared to the Pi, but a different mother board such as the Mini-ITX with additional cards and ports on it can be used too. I haven't tried it yet as I don't have a spare Micro-USB right now to use in my Raspberry Pi 3, but if you guys think it's, possible next time I walk into my town's computer store I might buy one with the intent of flashing OpenTPCast to it.",1575381506.0,2,0,196791

oculus,Rift S is a definite upgrade over the CV1,"With the current holiday VR deals, I decided to rid myself of the Oculus sensors once and for all. I brought home a shiny new Rift S. Most reviews mentioned this as being the primary reason to ""upgrade"", but were hesitant to really call the Rift S a proper successor. Well, after 4 hours with the headset, I'd say this is very clearly better than my CV1. It's like experiencing VR again for the first time.

**Note:** The Rift S has very distinct physical limitations not found in the CV1/Quest related to the lack of physical IPD adjustments. The Rift S presents no upgrade worth suffering if you are outside of the supported range.

**Specs Don't Lie, They Just Don't Tell the Whole Truth**

The Rift S has deceptively bad specs. Slightly higher resolution but a drop in refresh rate and panel quality. You'd be forgiven if you mistook the Rift S as a new budget model. Yes, it has inside-out tracking, and yes it has a more comfortable mount, but both of those things can be solved by us, the consumer, with a little more money and elbow grease. Yet, there exists another thing that we cannot fix that desperately needs to be: The Lenses

**The Spotlight is Gone**

The biggest problem with the CV1 has got to be the Godrays. They destroy clarity, image quality, and immersion. Like a bright shining beacon hiding behind every object that comes your way, the godrays created by the CV1 lenses cheapened the entire experience. On the Rift S they are greatly reduced to the point of being a graphical feature rather than distortion.

If I had to rate the intensity of the Godrays from 1-10, the CV1 would be a 7 and the Rift S a 3. I'm sure it can get even better, but I feel like we're at the threshold where it's ""good enough"".

**Is it Hot in Here?**

Speaking of image clarity, no one mentions the CV1 being prone to getting fogged up. I guess because it's just a problem in the first 10 minutes of play, but I can't tell you how many times I've had to readjust my headset to stop my breath from fogging up the lenses. Even the moisture from your eyes is enough to get it misty. Has not happened with the Rift S yet. I put it on and it's good right from the start.

**Replacing the Screen Door**

While OLED is superior in black level and color vividness, LCD has the benefit of being brighter with better pixel arrangement. That means that you're seeing less dot pitch and more of a seamless image. In the CV1 I was able to see the space between pixels very easily, but the Rift S does a much better job of hiding this. There are times when the SDE just.. disappears.

**Playing More Makes Sense**

There is nothing inherently wrong with the sensor system on the CV1. What inside-out tracking provides is ease of scalability. Everyone knows that if you're playing in multiple rooms or using a VR capable laptop the Rift S is a huge benefit, but not many people mention how awesome it is for going from room-scale to sitting at a desk. Or laying in bed. Or just facing an entirely different direction from where your computer is.

I don't have a dedicated space to play VR so this appeals to me on an entirely different level than someone who does. I need to make the best out of my available space as soon as it comes up. That might mean playing Vader Immortal in my desk chair or beat saber in the space by the door. I couldn't before. Now I can.

**Being Alone With Your Thoughts is Scary**

Some people love being fully immersed and closed off from the real world when they play in VR. That's scary to me. I'm always conscious of someone walking up to me or needing my attention. I know the Guardian system is there, but since I do move around I end up turning that off. For that reason I usually don't fully place the headphones or often peek through the little space above my nose. The Rift S solves this problem completely by allowing me to see through the cameras.

I can align with reality while being in virtual reality.

**Not Quite Refreshed**

So why bother with the CV1 if you can get the Rift S? 90hz screens. I'll always reiterate that playing VR is better than no VR, and if 90hz makes you feel a bit queazy, 80hz can likely make you feel super queazy. There is a difference, and I would be weary of getting feedback from anyone that says otherwise.

I've adapted to playing VR so I don't feel motion sick, but I can appreciate the difference in refresh rate. It's not a deal breaker for me by any means, but it's there. One of those aspects that you can clearly see the next version improving.

**The Quest for the Right Headset**

So I fully believe the Rift S is a full and complete upgrade from the CV1, but does that mean it's the only upgrade? Not by a long shot. I plan on trying out a Quest in the near future and seeing if the Rift S holds up. Just like there are things that the Rift S provides above and beyond a spec sheet, the Quest provides a feature you can't find elsewhere for the same cost: Untethered gameplay. Lots of us would give up a bit of graphical clarity for an entirely new experience all together. The question is whether I would, and I'm dying to find out.

I hope I was able to help any of you who were on the fence just like me. It sucks to know that we spent over $700 for the CV1 experience only for it to be replaced by a $350 bundle, but I think the Rift S is worth the money. There's a big hurdle with improving resolution in future headsets and it's not just the headset itself but also the computer. Ask yourself if you plan on spending another $600-800 in the near future for a graphics card upgrade. If the answer is no, then Rift S or Quest Link might be the best you can handle. If the answer is yes, then you need to ask yourself how long you are willing to wait before the next headset.",1575333535.0,21,32,196791

oculus,1 Day in VR: My Experience,"I purchased a rift S after years of wanting to be apart of the VR world, and it is incredible. So far I’d say I’ve spend about 4ish hours between a few games...mainly super hot and Arizona sunshine. 

Outside a few crashes, everything has worked fairly easily. I haven’t quite figured out navigating VR outside of games. Oculus and steam each have their own “home,” and neither seem to have all my games in one place. To view my VIVEPORT games I have to open vive up and it essentially shows just like my desktop. That has been less than ideal, but honestly I think is more due to me not knowing how to use the software then the software itself. Any guidance would be helpful! 

The Rift S itself has been amazing. Extremely easy setup, great display, comfortable fit. The sound, of course, is just okay and can be improved with earbuds or a headset. So far I’ve honestly been okay with the built in headphones, but everything just sounds okay. The tracking of my body and head movement as well as hands is very good. I have a fairly small play area to work with, it meets the minimum recommendation, but still nothing impressive. I’ve hit the wall a couple times( sorry neighbor,) but generally the guardian does a good job at telling me where I am. I turned it up a bit to given me more of a warning with my small area. 

Motion sickness has been iffy. Any game where I start to feel sick I have put off for now. After playing superhot or Arizona sunshine for an hour or so I will feel the need to take off my headset. It’s a very slight uncomfort, and something that I think time will fix. Games with sliding are rough right now, and have avoided as such. Teleporting isn’t ideal for me gameplay wise, but it does a MUCH better job at keeping your head ok. 

Overall, very impressed with the technology and can’t wait to experience more. I know I have just touched the tip of the iceberg. 

This has been a quick and not planned out description of what my experience has been so far, but I hope it helps someone looking into VR. Ask me questions or give me suggestions if you have any!",1575325597.0,27,41,196791

SILICON RISING is more and more close the Release day.

 

**About SILICON RISING**

OUR GAME IS a first-person VR shooting game with fast pace and uses human body’s instinct reaction to play. The stimulation of bullets flying over your ear will make you totally immerse into it and can’t help squatting down, turning to one side or looking for shelter to escape the bullets. At the same time ,you have to pay attention to your back, because the enemies never only attack you from the front, please apply your excellent shooting shills to deal with the enemies again and again.",1575390811.0,0,2,196791

oculus,"I was wrong, SO very wrong!, I'm sorry!","So years ago way back in 2015 is when I first experienced VR, It was in the form of google cardboard on my Galaxy S5. The lack of real fun games on cardboard left me with a bad taste in my mouth and I assumed that this would be the same crappy experience on a real VR headset. I can't believe how damn naive I was to believe that a real HMD like the oculus would be disappointing like cardboard, But damn I gotta say I was dead wrong, so wrong in fact that I'm mentally beating myself up about it. I should have bought a Rift years ago and can't believe I'm just now joining real VR gaming for the first time. I feel like a jackass tbh. I had a powerful PC too since 2013. I finally got to jump into some real VR games today now that my family went back home after staying over the weekend for thanksgiving. So I had a lot of time for myself finally. Today I played Robo Recall and that alone made me pause and just be in sheer awe at the experience I was having, It was like feeling like a kid again at the arcades, And not only was I having a blast but I was getting exercise too! After playing some beat saber today I was exhausted! But thats a good thing, I am 280 and overweight, This VR thing can definitely help me get more active and lose weight, Thats a WIN WIN in my book. 

So I just wanna say sorry, I made several comments over the years on Reddit, Facebook ect saying that VR sucks and that its never going to go mainsteam because its too expensive ect..  I am here to stay and I cant believe it but I'm already looking to upgrade from the CV1, Which BTW I bought as a way to introduce myself into VR to see if I like it before I go full swing and buy a more expensive Rift S or maybe the Vive index. I got my CV1 from Ebay for $180. Came with 2 sensors and both touch controllers.",1575253428.0,592,224,196790

oculus,"Oculus support of next gen XBOX, reasoning","[I know Phil Spencer has come out stating that he just doesn't see enough traction in VR yet](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2019-11-28-phil-spencer-nobodys-asking-for-vr-on-xbox) to support it on the next xbox console, certainly not on the same level as Playstation with their own titles and headset(s).

What I wonder is why wouldn't Oculus consider working with Microsoft to bring Rift S or Quest Link support to the new XBOX?  There seem to be a ton of positives for both companies, a lot of hard work is already done.

\+ XBox Scarlett (next gen Xbox) is a closed system with fixed specs, it would be MUCH easier to support both hardware and software wise when developing both drivers (for the headset) and software (games/experiences) when you know EXACTLY what your hardware performance budget would be on a fixed platform

\+ Scarlett will very likely already have the necessary physical connections (HDMI, USB3)

\+ Scarlett is a much easier point of entry for your average consumer (go to the store, buy console, buy headset), no longer worrying about CPU/GPU/USB bandwith, different hardward configurations, bad drivers, users trying to buy a shitty pre-built PC with underpowered components having a horrible first experience since set-up and configuration of a console is MUCH easier

\+ Much larger target audience for Oculus to sell software and hardware to, yes yes I know PC gaming is huge and global but again not anywhere as easy to get into as going to your local electronics shop and picking up a console

\+ Driver functionality is already on Windows platforms, would require porting but it's not from some exotic not well understood platform, yes XBOX has it's own set of architecture but with Microsoft pushing development to their platforms to be similar (write once port few) I don't imagine it would be hugely destabilizing to their already existing software

\+ No longer hands the future of VR on consoles to Sony, more reasons for developers to no longer think of Sony as the only place they can sell their software in that space

\+ Key differentiator for Microsoft, showing that they're open to working with products you already own, you can play games on a console OR PC with the same headset

I'm sure there would be a fair bit of work for both companies, MS would have to support Oculus from an OS level since all the tracking stuff would have to be done in the background (probably difficult to run both tracking software and games at the same time without OS level support for this.  Oculus would have to port a lot of their existing software and it's not clear how buying software would work since both companies have their own stores.  

Still to me the positives seem pretty significant for this sort of partership.",1575395027.0,0,7,196790
oculus,ITCH.IO not launching to the headset,"I used to play a few free VR games on itch.io but I had not played them in months. Before, I would simply click play and they would work just fine. However, I just went back to try and play some like ""Tea For God"" and I found that I was having all kinds of problems. Sometimes they say you must have a VR headset to play. Sometimes they would launch, but just as a regular desktop version. Or when I would go into their files and launch them manually they would load to the headset....kinda....they would never actually open the game. Just the loading screen. I tried selecting the run in Oculus file for tea for god. I tried having steam VR on and off. I tried a wrapping program. Nothing.... I tried to Google this and I only found a few isolated posts. My headset is a CV1 and I run Windows 10. Itch is up to date as well as all the games. I don't know what to do at this point.",1575372808.0,1,2,196790
oculus,My Oculus Rift S works occasionally. Should I return it and get a new one?,"I got my Rift S on Thanksgiving night from Best Buy. I brought it home and had trouble setting it up. My friend eventually got it working, and we had fun playing for a few hours.

The next day I went to play and I got stuck in a loop. My software would say, ""Oculus software restart required."" I would press the button and the software would either stay on the screen it was at or it would restart and it would say the same thing. I would also put on the headset to see if it would turn on even with it saying this, and I would either see a black screen or a screen with three white dots.

I eventually deleted all Oculus files from my computer and reinstalled the software. The setup was smoother than before so I thought it had fixed. 

Either later that night or the next day, I went to play it again and it shut off mid-game twice. Ever since then it has been occasionally working for no real reason. I've searched the internet for answers, even got recommendations from Oculus support, and switched USB and DVI ports. Nothing seems to fix any of my problems.

The thing I noticed that is bugging me is that the left hand side of the left lens is much blurrier than any other part of any lens. The right lens has good clarity right across the entire lens, but the left one definitely gets blurrier on the left hand side, and particularly on the bottom left hand quadrant of the lens. 

It makes looking at static things to my left difficult since the right lens is perfectly fine, but it doesn't quite cover the same field of view as the left lens.  It's not an eye sight issue.

I've read this post already: https://uploadvr.com/oculus-rift-s-valve-index-no-hdmi/ and still can't tell whether or not my laptops GPU is connected to the USB C. The USB C port is definitely a thunderbolt 3 bolt (pulling directly from the tech specs it's USB 3.1 Gen2 Type-C over Thunderbolt).

oculus,My CV1 goes black we can't find your headset?,"So I pre ordered a CV1 way back the night it was announced. 2500K user who upgraded to a GTX 1080 for rift. I played luckys tail with the Xbox controller but realised without controllers it was rubbish and put it back in the box. Pre ordered touch and when it arrived (I bought 2 sets to get a 3rd sensor) thought that I had a problem with my 2500K mobo usb. I bought an Inateck 4 port USB 3 and seemingly ever few minutes of robo recall I maybe got 5 frustrating hours total out of it. I just decided my computer was to blame.

A few months ago I upgraded to a 3700X with a new x470 Taichi USB 3 ports all over the place. I just plugged everything in and set it up firmware update on the rift headset and ""black screen we cant find your headset"" I have stolen the Inateck 4 port from the old pc and installed that it only powers the rift headset. And still it seems any head movements outside of GENTLE seem to kill this thing.

The rift CV1 is a straight piece of trash isn't it? There is no way for me to fix this problem it's a hardware problem that seems to go away briefly if I smash the touch controller into the sides and back of my own skull in frustration.

I always loved the idea of VR fuck I hate this POS. I even bought H3VR assuming the new PC would fix my issues. What a waste of money.

Not having to worry about stupid sensors is great. The bad, for some reason I keep feeling ""sick"". I got my VR feet a long time ago, and have played on my CV1 for thousands of hours and only rarely have I experienced sickness since upgrading to a 2080 Ti.  
I think that 80fps, just really doesn't sit well with me. Paying $1k for a Valve Index is just something I don't see myself doing, so I am thinking of just returning my Rift S and staying with the CV1 for a while.  
Is this just an individual thing, or is this common? I'm a bit worried for newcomers to VR if my experience is any indication of the average experience.  
Don't get me wrong, I absolutely loved the crisp visuals of the Rift S, but for some reason I got sick, and also my wife who doesn't like VR(despite me constantly forcing her to try it) in either headset said that she felt that it looked ""less real"".  
My IPS is 67, is it due to this? Is it the lower FPS? I'm no FPS queen, I'm fine gaming at 60fps.

On CV1, I remember being able to play even with GTX 970 on close to max settings and on GTX 1080 being able to super sample 150% at least.
I have checked NVENC compression takes only ~5-7% of GPU performance.
Weirdly GPU usage was sitting at ~60% and CPU ~40%, while Oculus performance overlay was showing close to 0 headroom.
Is there some plausible explanation for why is performance suddenly so bad? Is anybody experiencing something similar?

 him for christmas, but things are tight right now so it's not possible.

oculus,"Massive Technical Issues, any help is appreciated","I just got a Rift S last night, and since I got home I've had nothing but issues. I installed the app (using the beta), and plugged the headset in, however, I can't pair the touch controllers to the headset itself. When I try to pair the controllers, the light on the headset turns orange from white, then goes off, then goes back to orange, meanwhile in the app nothing happens for a varying amount of time until I get an error saying that there's a hardware issue preventing pairing.   


In addition to that,  the headset itself has been randomly disconnecting from my computer (hardware notification displayport disconnect), then reconnecting, then disconnecting again.  


I've plugged an xbox controller in, loaded steam VR, and I was able to use it for roughly five minutes before I got an error message saying that the display adapter has disconnected. It'll then reconnect a few seconds later. That's the only time I've managed to get it even close to working. Any other time I try to start steam VR, the display port disconnects. This has happened every time I've tried to start steam.  


So far, I've updated the following driversr (USB, graphics card, oculus driver etc), altered permissions to allow all camera/microphone permissions, turned off disconnect to save power functionality, plugged the rift into almost every usb port on my computer (always plugging the usb in before the display adapter).  


Meanwhile, since I started this process, my other usb devices have started intermittently disconnecting

My specs on my computer are as follows  


Amd Radeon 290 graphics card (minimum card, but at this point i'm just trying to get this working)

oculus,Upcoming VR headsets. When?,"I pre-ordered the CV1 back when it was announced and sold it about a year ago. I sold it because, although I am a massive fan of VR and still super excited about it, I felt like I had seen everything gen 1 had to offer and the CV1 screen just wasn't cutting it anymore.

I still really want another VR headset, but I've decided that the Valve Index is the minimum I am willing to put up with in terms of overall experience, and I am not willing to pay that kind of price. So I'm waiting for either a price cut or a new headset.

As far as I can tell, no new VR headsets have been announced for 2020. Surely we will get something new from either the usual suspects or Hp, or Samsung? or have HP and Samsung given up on VR altogether? 2019 was a good year for VR in terms of numbers, and the market is expected to expand significantly over the coming years, so it's surprising no new headsets are even being hinted at.

I am also really surprised Oculus aren't releasing a high end VR headset for enthusiasts. I don't see why it couldn't co-exist with their current heasets.

Other than that, any idea when we will start seeing discounts on the Index? I can't remember how long it took for them to discount the vive.",1575325400.0,5,14,196791

oculus,Quest vs Rift S purchase and IPD problem,"Greetings!

I'm looking at purchasing either the Quest or Rift S at the moment. Those are the only options I have, can't get any of the other headsets on my country. I also cannot buy something and then return it later, so my purchase would be pretty much final.

I want to, mostly, play PCVR games. The issue is, I have a far IPD of 70.7.

I tested the Rift S for like half an hour and it wasn't catastrophically blurry, but there's the sense that something was not right and the image was not perfectly clear. Also somehow the FOV was really low. In my experience it was even lower than the PSVR fov, and the PSVR isn't great at all in any regard. Didn't try adjusting the eye relief slider before putting the headset on my face (only adjusted it after wearing the headset), but I don't know if that would make any difference on the FOV.

So then I was also looking at the Quest, since it has a mechanical IPD adjustment. However, it seems that a lot of people are having issues with Link (yeah it's a beta, but no guarantees that the experience will rival a native PCVR solution), and it's honestly a concerning. Between the lower refresh rate, video compression stuff and other issues that I saw people having such as image freezes and random crashes/disconnects, it makes me think that purchasing this one would be a bit of a leap of faith that eventually it will be pretty much as good as other PCVR headsets.

If the rift S had an ipd slider this would be an easy choice. Thanks facebook!

Maybe I've missed something while searching for fixes, but I'll list everything I've tried below. It's clearly a software problem as I doubt I would get the same error 3 times, with it being software the first 2 and suddenly hardware on the 3rd.

- Restarted software multiple times
- Restarted PC
- Disconnected and reconnected headset
- All of the above in multiple different orders
- Turned off and on camera access in Windows 10 privacy settings - WORKED

Sunday
- All of the above
- Reinstalled Oculus software (took 2 hours)
- Removed Rift S from devices in Oculus software and performed Rift S first time setup again - WORKED

Monday
- All of the above (minus 2 hour reinstall)
- First time setup results in either perpetual sensor check or ""Sensors can't track headset"" error

oculus,Modifying Rift S touch controllers to have a better grip button - Questions,"Hello everyone. I was considering 3d printing a sort of plate or new button to replace the current grip button to be bigger and offer more natural grip of in game items.

Keep in mind, this is assuming you have some sort of way to strap the controller to your hand, something generally like the index has.

My questions are:

Are the grip buttons capacitive? I havent encountered a game that uses it (or can't recall at this moment), if it is. This would most likely make this project dead in the water.

Would the community find this useable or interesting? Consider that this most likely would void any sort of warranty if the final solution requires taking the controller apart.

Any games that this could enhance? B&amp;S and Pavlov come to mind.

oculus,Yet another Rift S vs Quest report,"I'll try to keep it short.

I own CV1 and OGO and ordered Rift S to potentially replace CV1 and Quest to potentially replace CV1 and OGO.

Here are my findings.

**Rift S**

\-Clarity: ridiculously good, much better than expected. Why were so many people claiming that it's only a small improvment to CV1? For me it's a massive step. I can not just read things more easily than I could before, I can easily read things that I wouldn't have thought were even possible to read in VR.

&amp;#x200B;

\-No more god rays, yay!

&amp;#x200B;

\-Sweetspot? The whole lens is a massive sweetspot. I can look with my eyes in all directions and I don't need to waste any time with adjusting the postition of my headset all the time. This probably also why they can get away with no IPD adjustment.

&amp;#x200B;

\-The cable is longer, yay, I can turn my PC back to facing the right way...

&amp;#x200B;

\-Audio: they've got to be kidding me. I was expecting bad, but this is a joke.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Tracking: didn't notice anything out of the ordinary.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Comfort: I was scared at first, since design reminded me of the terrible Odyssee+ but I have to say: it's even better than CV1.

&amp;#x200B;

\-FOV: this feels really tight, maybe it's the price you pay for the huge sweet spot.

&amp;#x200B;

\-What's that button on the bottom? A mechanism to adjust the distance of the lenses to the face? Wow. Why wasn't anyone talking about this? Will make it much easier to maximise FOV and allow glasses wearers to try the headset.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Passthrough: OMG. Game changer. Put on the headset, don't take it off to have a drink, speak to the wife, get my chair, find my keyboard etc. You can even use it as an AR device where you walk around the room, from one huge screen to the next.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Negatives: Audio, Audio, Audio, and the cable is much more ""sticky"" compared to CV1. Will try to fix it using a mesh sleeve.

&amp;#x200B;

**Quest (Link)**

\-People wern't kidding, it's uncomfortable immediately. Nowhere near Odyssee+ levels of uncomfortableness, so not a complete show stopper, but investing time and money to fix it isn't very appealing to me.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Hello god rays, hello SDE, I missed you.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Visuals: better than CV1, but not close to Rift S.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Audio: same as Rift S.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Supports passthrough but not by double-tapping a button. Wtf?

&amp;#x200B;

\-Volume buttons! Why couldn't they add this to Rift S?

&amp;#x200B;

\-Performance: terrible, smooth 80/90 in Skyrim on Rift (S), 36fps on Quest? What gives? Investigated and it turns out that Quest link has a much higher render target resolution than Rift and Rift S. After reducing it using Debug tools performance was fine, but the fact remains that ASW at 36fps isn't the same thing as ASW at 40 or 45 fps.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Can I sell my OGO? Nope. Many apps aren't available at all, like the Felix and Paul documentaries or Pigasus player. There is no way to switch user accounts other than factory reset (I have two accounts, one for Rift, one for OGO). Sideloading OGO apks to Quest will mostly result in ""entitlement error"", regardless of whether it's a free or paid app, or if it's an app I bought on the active account.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Untethered Quest native apps: for me 72 fps is not really enough buttery smoothness and playing untethered in the same space in which I could just use a cable doean't really seem like a game changer. A game changer would have been if the Quest library had taken off as a VR console with AAA exclusive games like on Switch. But it didn't turn out that way, Quest library are just low-spec and expensive versions of PCVR games. While in the mean time PCVR gets HLA, Asgard's, Stormlands and Boneworks.

&amp;#x200B;

**The verdict**

oculus,"Should I gift my father the Oculus Go, or Quest?","So I had my father over a few days ago and showed him Google Earth in VR on my Rift S, and it completely blew him away. He isn't much of a gamer, though he used to be and I could see him going that direction if given a low maintenance option (Rift S and gaming computer certainly is not in the cards). He told me he was thinking about getting something for VR in the near future so I figured this might be the perfect gift for him if I can narrow it down to the right device. I understand that there is a 200 dollar difference and that with the quest you're getting two controllers versus one, and access to more games. How substantial is the spec difference between these two? Is one more user friendly than the other? My gut tells me he is more than likely going to stick to non gaming experiences with the VR, but I'm hoping you all might be able to provide more insight on what he's really going to get out of the Go or Quest.

It created waves on the internet and received a lot of media attention, including articles from Road To VR, [EDM.com](https://EDM.com), and DJ Mag.

Next I'm looking to produce a no-budget GORILLAZ inspired VR project based on the music video for FEEL GOOD INC. It will be an immersive, interactive experience to be played on 6DOF headsets, like Vive, Rift and (potentially) Quest.

I'm looking to build a team of talented and/or passionate collaborators to help bring this experience to life! Here's a list of roles I'm looking to fill:

oculus,"Serious troubles with Rift S, should I consider returning?","Hey everyone!

The other day (4 days ago) I got my Rift S, and to be completely honest setting it up and getting it to work has been a nightmare that hasn't yet ended.

Don't get me wrong, the headset is great &amp; I'd love to keep it but at this point I either need someone to help me out NOW or the headset is being returned to retail.

Basically, problem 1:  
The right hand controller is only half functioning, half of the ring is out and the other half has IR lights that are extremely dim.

Problem 2:  
When the rift is plugged in &amp; running on my head my internet just conks out, kaput, gone. No idea why, I've attempted to change channels &amp; try running only on 5.0ghz but this has not changed anything at all. (I've tried resetting my internet multiple times too &amp; am unable to use an Ethernet cable)

Problem 3:  
The headset has to be uplugged &amp; replugged in almost every time I first start my PC, and even then sometimes it wont start correctly, forcing me to unplug the cable from the HMD, which 100% of the time fixes the issue.

Have I tried troubleshooting all of these? Yes. I've restarted my computer multiple times, I've messed around with my PC settings (USB power saving etc), I've re-installed the software 3 times now &amp; have tried repairing the install a couple times too &amp; many more methods.

I've tried holding on to it but really at this point I think it's a lost cause, I've been in contact with Oculus but having to wait 2 days for every response is not worth it. It's basically just been 4 days of trying to get the thing to work properly and I don't think the issues are justifying the high price spend.

I don't know if I'm just unlucky or doing something wrong.

Does anybody have any possible solutions to my issues before I end up sending it back to the retailer?

I don't mean to sound rude or dismissive, I am a huge VR enthusiast finally getting into the PC VR market and so far it's just been stressful and if possible I'd love to stick to this headset but these issues are killing me.

I have been saving up for my first VR headset, and I think I have decided on the Oculus Quest. My only problem is that I currently have an NVIDIA GeForce 1050 Ti, and from what I have read Link doesn't seem to support it. My question is- Does anyone know if this graphics card will be supported in the future, or is it just too old? I also have an AMD Ryzen 5 1600 for my CPU just to put that out there if it matters, but I think it is good enough (I don't know computers that well).

Another question that might be harder to answer is- If Link will not support my graphics card, do you think I should just get the Rift S, or should I upgrade my graphics card and then get the Quest? The only problem with this is that it would take me significantly more time to save up for both of these things, and one of the main reasons I want to get a VR headset is to play Steam games (like Elite Dangerous and Boneworks). So in this scenario, would I just be better off with a Rift S? I have heard some people say that the Rift S might become obsolete, and with Link it makes the Quest better in almost every way, but for someone in my position, do you think I should care to this extent?

oculus,Anyone managed to get Alien Isolation and MotherVR working with the Quest and Oculus Link?,"Played through AI in VR back on my DK2 back in the day, and have been waiting to relive the experience. After the announcement of Oculus Link, I went out and bought myself a Quest. Been absolutely LOVING it so far, and have been playing Asgards Wrath and Blade and Sorcery all weekend.

Spent about half an hour trying to get Alien Isolation up and running in VR, but with no luck. The latest version of MotherVR is correctly installed. Here's what I was trying:

1. Start up Oculus Link.
2. Use the virtual desktop option to launch SteamVR.
3. Launch Alien Isolation throught SteamVR.

At this point, 90% of the time it would either not load up or it would say that it was already running. I managed to get it working once. At the menu, it looked like I was in a theater watching the menu on a big screen.

4. Go into the options and enable VR mode with an Oculus headset.
5. Started the game but it froze on a cutscene.

Wasn't able to get it up and running again. Anyone successfully managed to get the amazing game working on a Quest?",1575886391.0,5,19,196791

* Different Machines all together, I've tried it with laptops and desktops alike.
* Quest / PC Updated to latest versions
* Scanned for hardware changes in device manager

All cables I've tried have worked with other devices. I've been able to charge my phone or transfer data between it and the PC (tested with each port/PC) All that comes up is when I connect it to the Typc-C connector I get a USB Root Hub (USB 3.0) But nothing is visible under ""This PC"" Oculus app doesn't recognize that its connected either.

Quest is charging while plugged in but never notified by PC or the quest that its been connected. However I believe it had asked me at one point the FIRST time I plugged it in and now it no longer does.

I'm Simply wanting to connect it to the Oculus App.

oculus,How to Get Started With VR Porting?,"Hello, my name is Lucas, I am a software developer and I just became the proud owner of an Oculus Quest!

I'm aware that right now there is no ""AAA"" VR game (at least until HL: Alyx), but through ports like Skyrim VR, Fallout VR and unofficial ports like Doom 3 BFG, you can experience really long games in a completely new light.

Ports like these fascinate me, and since I'm a long time fan of the Elder Scrolls series, I wondered if there was a Morrowind port. I found that there was one made a long time ago, called Morrowrift, but that unfortunately didn't have motion controller support and was eventually abandoned.

I'm of the philosophy that if something you want doesn't exist, you should make it, so I set my sights on making a new Morrowind VR port with the new OpenMW engine, since I could have access to its source code. But even though I have some game development knowledge, I don't even know where to start porting this game, so here I am, asking for assistance, or any pointers at all, really.

Magnets! Sticking magnets on each one of your controllers  with opposite polarity's to bring resistince when your hands are close together trying to grip something.

I know this probably would not work to well and would not be to precise, but my long term idea is to put magnets in haptic gloves to help simulate resistance and pull.

Just a thought that maybe some big shot will see this and think OH YEAH! that is the idea we were missing for good vr gloves.  Probably not tho :(

oculus,Some Love for Westworld Awakening,"Westworld Awakening has been sitting in my Oculus library since launch day and I finally got into it, and boy am I glad I did. I’m not seeing too much love for the game on this subreddit, so I thought I’d share mine.

This is perhaps one of the best VR narratives that I’ve had the pleasure of experiencing, and that’s what this is: an experience mixed with gamey puzzle elements. The polish on this title has blown me away. It’s environments are visually stunning and although the game doesn’t have you shooting and blasting your way out of DELOS, it does have you ducking for cover, sneaking past enemies, and scanning items in the world, all in an effort to further the narrative it’s trying to create--and with great success.

You play as a female Host named Kate, who is programed to experience a living hell day in and day out. Like I said before, you’re not the one doing the hunting and shooting in this story. There are people coming after you, and this game does its darndest to make you feel that way. I felt the sheer terror and vulnerability of being a host, destined to die. It’s astonishing and frightening, much more than I initially anticipated, though it should be noted that it’s not always this way. Westworld Awakening expertly balances horror, adventure, and mystery throughout it’s 4 chapters.

One of the things this game does best is immerse you through its dialogue and characters. Though there aren’t too many to keep track of, those you encounter will be memorable, as you find that most things aren’t what they appear to be. You spend a lot of time listening to a dude through an earpiece, but the dialogue between your character and the guy is so good, you can’t help but feel like you’ve gotten to know the two.

After each chapter, the game will ask if you want to continue, and I always found myself doing so. Similar to the TV show, each chapter leaves the player on some sort of cliffhanger that has you begging to find out what happens next, and that’s just evidence of compelling story-telling. While the story itself isn’t complicated, the way the game puts you in the center of the action makes it that much more engaging. The ending was pretty good. I think it could have been wrapped up with a better final scene, but I was ultimately left satisfied. I think you’ll definitely find it more appealing if you’re a fan of the series, but even if you know nothing about the show, the game gives you enough context throughout your adventure so that you’re not left feeling like some sort of interloper of the fandom.

The only bug I ran into was once when I had to scan objects on walls, but because I already moved made my way into different rooms while the dialogue was still going, I wasn’t able to continue because I assumed progressed too fast and the game got confused. On the flip side, the game does quick-save constantly, so you’re able to reload checkpoints and they’ll spawn you not too far from where you left off.

In terms of locomotion options, both are smooth, and there is no option for teleportation. By default the game is set to arm swing locomotion, where you'll move forward and in the direction your headset is facing when you swing your arms back and forth as if you're walking. Personally, I'm not a fan, so I switched to smooth locomotion via joystick. I don't think the game came with this option when it first released, so kudos to the devs for the update! Also, there's both snap and smooth turning.

Game-length wise, the game spans 4 chapters, with each chapter taking me roughly an hour to complete. I don’t feel as if I rushed through it, but I saw what I wanted to see and read what I wanted to read. Depending on if reading logs on a tablet is your kind of thing, this game may take slightly longer or shorter.

The title is currently on sale on both Steam and the Oculus Store for $29.99, and I wholeheartedly recommend it!

\- I saw VRCover doing good products but [doesn't have any Rift S facial interface](https://vrcover.com/oculus-rift-s/). 

\- [AMVR did one for the Rift S](https://www.amazon.com/AMVR-Interface-Bracket-Leather-Replacement/dp/B07Z3DW7T5?language=en_US) but it's out of stock everywhere (in France, even in the US), a ""knock-off"" brand did this [but it's probably cheap](https://www.amazon.fr/Eyglo-Couverture-Protecteur-Respirant-Remplacement/dp/B07YTSFC3P/ref=sr_1_7?__mk_fr_FR=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&amp;keywords=Rift+S&amp;qid=1575841996&amp;sr=8-7), and with the AMVR facial interface, the ""plastic interface"" and foam is given, but sadly if you buy the knock-off, you'll have to remove the Stock foam from your Rift S.

\- I tried [this cotton cover and it's really bad](https://www.amazon.fr/Akakawa-Oculus-Rift-Cover-Pack/dp/B07TW6G19Z/ref=sr_1_1?__mk_fr_FR=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&amp;keywords=Rift+S+cover&amp;qid=1575843077&amp;sr=8-1).

Sweating in the HMD is a pain, and I'm not the only one in the house using it. :/

What is happening ? VRCover is too busy to build a facial interface ? I don't understand why nobody is looking for an alternative way to the stock facial interface.

It has been as cheaper on clearance, but this is still a solid deal at almost half off.  It comes in three colors so you can do patterns if you like.  It's also moisture-resistant and super easy to cut and work with so if you want to do a whole room you can cut it down to fit flush.

Probably not the best if you have carpet in your VR area, but I really like these types of mats underneath a round rug.  Gives a little more cushion jumping around or if you are playing a game that you get low in (hands knees or crawling).  I rarely see my guardian boundary anymore because I know ahead of time that I'm stepping off the mat-raised rug.

oculus,Probably scratched my lenses...best course of action?,"Hi there,

I have the Rift S since last weekend and so far am loving it. However, today I noticed smudges on the lenses, a bigger one on the left lense and a smaller one on the right lense, that I don't seem to be able to clear using a microfiber cloth: [https://imgur.com/a/HEUbTec](https://imgur.com/a/HEUbTec)

I'm wearing glasses and so far have been using the Rift S ""by the book"", only using a clean microfiber cloth provided by my optician, using the button on the headset to provide more space for the glasses and putting the heaset on like described on the oculus website. So I find it a bit annoying, mildly speaking, that the lenses are so sensitive they already caught scratches after one week/maybe 4 longer sessions, even paying attention to all the caveats.

Since I received the headset only one week ago I could potentially return it, but I got it through a special Black Friday deal, and if I were to buy a new one I'd pay 100€ more than I originally paid.

So what would you do in my case? The scratches are not that big, noticeable in VR when paying attention to it, but bearable. My idea would be to get prescription lenses from VR optician or Widmo VR (which one is better, is there any difference?) and if the scratches keep getting worse or start to annoy me more, use something like polywatch. Or do you guys have a better idea?",1575840520.0,3,2,196791
oculus,OG Touch Controllers have broken vibrations,"Hey, so I'm running the OG Rift on my PC (3600 and 5700xt) and the vibrations are messed up. Everything was working fine until Oculus auto-updated drivers. My PC would randomly BSOD during gameplay. I gave it like a week and updated drivers again. No more BSOD and I could play VR again. In Robo Recall, something didn't feel right, but I kept playing. It wasn't until I played Beat Saber when I really noticed the problem:

Touching the Sabers together usually gives a really nice vibration that's rather convincing. Instead, it buzzed for a fraction of a second and stopped. The same went for every time I hit a note.

I thought something was wrong with the motors and that they were breaking. I don't have the money to replace the controllers, so I decided to just deal with it. Then the weirder thing happened.

I have no Idea why, but in Superhot, the controllers vibrate for way too long than too short. Every time I pick up a weapon, it buzzes for 3 seconds. Fire: constant vibration. Finish the level and grab the pyramid? full 10ish seconds of vibration.

At this point I'm thoroughly confused. I'm pretty sure it's not the hardware cause it's different in every game I play. I found a similar thread that said to remove the batteries and reconnect them, but it did nothing. If anybody has an idea, I'll try it, cause nothing I've done has worked.",1575861470.0,1,2,196791

oculus,Anyone else have had a hard time with shipping because Oculus forgot the commercial invoice?,"Ordered my Rift S the 29th during the BF promo. After my card denied the transaction on the 30th (flagged it as fraud), Oculus Support responded to my ticket within 30 minutes and my transaction was fixed.

It shipped last week and my package was supposed to arrive on Thursday. On Thursday, will keeping track of my package, UPS say they are returning the package to sender. I call UPS and they inform me that the sender forgot to put the commercial invoice on the box, so they can’t ship it to Canada and that I should contact the sender (Oculus).

I then proceed to open a ticket explaining the situation, waiting a day without answer. After a live chat with an agent, they inform me that I would need to wait for them to receive the returned package and then wait 4 business days for them to investigate. I inform them that it seems like a pretty long delay and that in about 2 weeks I will be away on vacation without internet access, which is a bit troublesome given the situation. I said it would be much faster to simply send a new unit, as the error is on their part and the package never even left the US.

A day later, someone else replies to my ticket informing me that I will be receiving a reimbursement in 5-7 business days and that I would be able to re-order another Rift S by then, ensuring that I update my shipping info (implying there was an error with my shipping info when there wasn’t at all, I checked).

I responded that I did not want to order a new Rift S at full price when I bought mine at the BF reduced price. I contacted the live chat and the agent told me that he forwarded that to a new team which will respond to it in 4 business days.

Is this really supposed to be this way? I feel like this is getting ridiculous as I made no error placing my order and now I’m stuck on knowing nothing about what or when anything is going to happen.

Ironically, possibly the only situation where having only USB 3.0 for your I/O is a downside. That's right. Not a single lick of USB 2.0. Rear I/O, 3 separate dual USB 3.0 ports side-to-side. A thunderbolt port. And just the standard video/audio ports. Two USB 3.0s on the front too, dang.

Oculus recommends putting any 3rd or 4th sensor on USB 2.0. Many say this is helps prevent any tracking issues. I reckon it's because having 3+ sensors gobbling USB 3.0 bandwidth is a sure way to slow things down.

oculus,Rift S vs WMR Tracking - is it worth the upgrade?,"So I'm still a newbie into the VR World. I've had my ASUS WMR for the last year and it's worked well - I enjoy it a lot although I do have some gripes with it. Calibrating height with WMR feels like it's harder than it should be, and some games don't feel great until you finally find good controller settings. I don't have a ton of space in my room, so I generally do just a standing experience at the moment. 

&amp;#x200B;

My real question is, does the Rift S have better tracking than WMR? And better clarity? I can't really change the IPD of the Asus headset, so what I have is what I get, but I think the Rift S can have that changed?

oculus,Why does nobody talk about the small Rift S FOV?,"So, first of sorry if my english is not perfect, it's not my first language.

&amp;#x200B;

I currently have 3 VR headsets at home: Oculus Rift S, Quest and now even an Index.

The FOV of the Rift S is so bad I just can't play with it anymore and am now in the process of selling it. The FOV of the Quest isn't alot better then the Rift S but it feels so much better and immersive while the Rift S takes me complete out of the immersion. So I even prefer to play with the Quest through Oculus Link then with the Rift S.

Some people might say it's because of my IPD (it's not I have 63)  or because of the cover and it's not close enaugh to my eyes but no, I am able to put the headset that close to my eyes until I see all 4 edges of the screen, it looks like I'm watching through a carboard box which is even more immersiom breaking, and still the FOV is much smaller then the Quest while I can't see any edges of the Quest.

&amp;#x200B;

So that is the only reason why I bought the Index. I really like the Oculus software, the tracking, the controllers, and the screen of the Rift S but the FOV is just too small for me.

&amp;#x200B;

What do you think of the FOV?

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: Ok so I just did the FOV test thanks to u/ThisNameTakenTooLoL ( [https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1359389601](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1359389601) )

I don't know if I did it correctly but I did all headsets the same it should give you a comparison.

(Horizontal, Vertical)

Index: H: 110 V:100

Quest: H:100 V:80

Rift S: H:85 V:80

oculus,First time Quest coming from Gear VR,"Initially I wanted to wait untill VR became more mature, but ever since my Samsung Galaxy S7 broke is was VR-less.

The Quest seemed to have the most bang for buck on the market because of its standalone and pc link capabillities.

I bought it tried it, and these are my impressions so far:

Pros compared to the gear vr:
- coming from a Gear vr positional tracking is a game changer foe me
- everything seems clearer, more optimized and snappier
- i love the 3d outside camera
- having hands inside the quest, much much better than the gear vr controller
- link
- standalone
- i use floorplanner.com for floorplans and now im able to walk around in the 360 vr exports of my floorplans

Cons compared to the Gear vr:
- there is some light refraction visible on the lenses
- there is some space around my nose where outside light comes trough
- eye strain after 10 minutes which worse and worse untill im unable to use the quest around the 15 min mark

Other cons:
- sometimes the controllers touch eachother, especially in boxing games",1575814893.0,3,5,196791

It's the old Question... What should I get for Christmas? 

I heard the Rift S has better visuals and (besides apparently lower resolutions) sharper images. Quest has better colours and a higher resolution per eye (but not as sharp pictures, even with Link) and apperently gets more support from oculus (handtracking, for example) 

I mainly want to play games and watch Movies with my future headset. 
The Quest has apperently more opportunities but the Rift is more comfortable. 


And because it matters: I have a gaming Laptop with a RTX 2060. And I am a guy who enjoys having good graphics 
(Would the Quest doesn't have the Link, it would be a no-brainer for me, but now the wireless seems like a really cool additional feature, which could be nice to have...)

Have a 1070 ti, i7-4790, 16 gigs of ram and in Stormland if I run it on medium or high settings the frame rate drops to 40hz in most places and aws kicks in. I have to run it on low settings to get 80 hz. What would improve my performance the most, a CPU upgrade since that is older? I thought the 1070 ti was still in the top 10 cards.

oculus,Oculus should really release more facial interfaces for the Rift S or at least release some CAD files so other can do so.,"My biggest gripe with my VR experience lately is that the facial interface just doesn't fit my face well and it's not very comfortable compared to my old CV1.  I have bought every 3rd party accessory I can find to improve the comfort but at the end of the day, the thing is just not shaped right for my face.   Maybe one day VR cover will release a new plastic interface, but I feel like this is an easier problem for Oculus themselves to solve, and an important one to address if they want to continue to grow the user base.

If you want to reduce friction to get people into VR, comfort is REALLY important.  I can be playing the best game in the world but if I'm feeling discomfort ON MY FACE of all places it's kinda hard to keep playing.  The HMD is a piece of clothing basically and the facial interface is where the HMD meets the face, it's really important, but so far is has not really been treated as such.

I see a lot of people on here over the years with the same problem and it seems pretty obvious it needs to be addressed.  People have all kinds of different face shapes and a one size fits all solution is doomed to leave many people uncomfortable.  

 All that Facebook money is great for doing the big R&amp;D stuff like varifocal lenses and cool new robot vision, but this problem is just molding some plastic a few different ways so people can be more comfortable.  This is low hanging fruit, but a big deal to the users.  

At the very least outsource the problem to the community and let us solve it but with some support from Oculus to help.  3d printers are pretty common, just give out the specs for printing the snaps so people can build their own and maybe sell them on etsy or something.  Or just sell a plastic plate with the snaps that we can glue our own solution to.  Or go all next level and do some kinda face scanning software that lets us 3d print a custom fit plate, that would be so Batman/Carmack.  And on the next headset, the magnetic snaps like the Index is using are a good idea, just copy that and make it easy for us.

oculus,I'm happy to say Boiling Steel is really good.,"If you like Sci fi shooters, killing lots of robots and just having a good time, this game might be for you.

Boiling steel is really fun imho. I have played it now for about 2-3 hours and I'm nowhere near the end.
It starts off somewhat basic, lots of boring dialogue and initially the shooting seems kinda basic. But the more you play you realize this part of the game was essentially an extended tutorial.

The real game starts after the third or so mission, maybe about 30 to 40 min. After that the game greatly opens up, allowing you to select your own mission and even do bonus missions for special rewards. 

The way the game works you are essentially a human who operates robots remotely. Something happens at the beginning of the game that makes all sorts of robots go crazy and attack the humans. It is up to you to find out what happened and how to fix it. I can't say much about the story but at this point I'm certainly intrigued and want to see where it goes. I've already seen one or two revelations  that intrigued me.


You go in missions, get rewards and upgrade your robot and your weapons. This ain't an rpg but there's certainly a progression system that you feel yourself getting stronger and more capable. 

The starting weapons are extremely weak and little by little they are getting better. But one of the most interesting things of the game is how you equip/ reload these weapons. 

You basically hold the grip button of your non dominant hand and a hologram shows up with your long range and your short range weapon. Then with your other hand you grip the hologram and expand it. Then the weapon materializes in your hand.  According to the story they are being ""teleported"" from somewhere. There's no reloading. Once the weapon runs out of ammo you have to do this all over again. 

So far all the weapons I've gotten are two handed but they are all pretty varied and have different handling and uses. 

The missions are usually pretty basic, go here, unlock this, open this gate etc but the combat is what really shines. Theres several types of enemies and they are pretty good at taking cover, throwing grenades and rushing you. 

Overall the combination of the combat, the weapon system, the story, the progression has made this game pretty enjoyable for me. 

For 20 bucks, you hardly can go wrong. I'm playing this on viveport and the viveport version actually supports oculus home from what I can tell. Runs as smooth as any native oculus game that I've seen. No hitches or anything. And also a lot of settings to tweak for comfort etc (game defaults to headset orientation) 

Give it a try, I'm sure if you are a fan of single player  shooters you will enjoy this a lot.

Edit : apparently the game is about 4 to 5 hours long according to the dev with more hours to be added as the game progresses in early access. (probably should have mentioned it is early access)

Another big criticism is that the game is definitely budget and indie. A lot of the voice acting is actually text to speech (a computer is talking to you). And the levels are reused for the missions.",1575761128.0,7,1,196792

Relatively new to VR titles. I picked up 2x rift s units after I took my oldest (11yr old) to a vr gaming joint. 

Looking for recommendations for decent 2 player titles. We’ve been playing Arizona sunshine into the ground, he loves horde mode.  


Also looking for titles that would appeal to younger kids, my youngest is 6 and feels a bit left out, AZS is a bit too complex for him. I grabbed into the blu for him and he really liked that, but looking for something a bit more interactive. 

Thanks for any help you can provide.

First off, we’d just like to say thanks to everyone who has supported us so far and welcome any newcomers to N1NE: The Splintered Mind.

We’re so grateful for all the support and feedback for the game we’ve received since we released our Alpha reveal trailer.

Today we are making an [announcement](https://www.od1nstudios.com/n1ne-the-splintered-mind-development-update/) that the team here has thought long and hard about. It’s not an easy decision for us but we feel it’s the best way for us to deliver a game that has a level of quality we as a team can be proud of.

And so, we are delaying the release of N1NE: The Splintered Mind Part 1.

We’d like to explain our decision making process in hopes of better communicating with all of you and strike a level of understanding for why we made the choice.

We also want to give you an update on where we are at and a look into the game, so we've written a blog post on our website with some additional info and new screenshots.

oculus,Low resolution,"Hi,

I just got my Rift S couple days ago and tried a few games but one thing is bothering me - all the games look really quite low resolution, so far I've tried Lost Echo, Onward, The Lab and a few other free games. I can make out text in the menus but really anything further than 5 meters is like 480p which makes playing games like Onward quite difficult since I can't spot enemies from afar easily. Is there some auto-scaling for VR? My GPU is quite weak (GTX 970) I was wondering if I'd need to buy a new one but all games run very smooth just extremely pixelated.

oculus,Unpopular Opinion - I prefer Rift S to Valve Index,"Hey All, fairly new to VR here. Little backstory  

&amp;#x200B;

I ordered a Valve index a few weeks ago, and was super excited. Boneworks, then HL:A, and Asgards Wrath (through Revive), I was just so excited! So excited in fact... That I couldn't wait to jump in, and ran out and bought a Rift S to play in the meantime, and maybe gift to my nephew once my Valve Index got in. I have been OBSESSED! I spent a ton of money on the steam VR sales, black friday oculus sales, and have been having a blast. But in the back of my mind was always the thought - ""This is going to be so much better when my Index comes in!""

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to this last Monday, got my Index, set it up (pain in the ass) and started playing. I was immediately disappointing. my first complaint was how much heavier the headset feels compared to my Rift S. It's noticeable, and I was constantly aware of it. Second issue - my play space is too small for the Steam VR ""full room scale"" chaperone set up (Valve's version of guardian"" so I couldn't even use it! I love my Rift S guardian, and has saved my ass a ton of times when playing Blade and Sorcery! Third issue, the cables dangling genuinely felt heavier, I noticed them more. It's a thicker cord, it weighs more than the Rift S, and it's noticeable. Forth issue (and it's a big one) I kept noticing these massive shines coming through my lenses while playing.. Like glare of some kind. I thought I had a defective unit, until I learned that it's something called ""Godrays"" and BOY is it bad. Like, REALLY bad when comparing to my Rift S. it was a constant distraction and I noticed it all of the time. 

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly? The amazing Oculus exclusives, eco system, recent innovations coming out of the Oculus team, makes me really excited about the future and investing into the Oculus eco system. Yeah, the on-board speakers suck ass, but I have a really good computer speaker set up, and just crank the volume when playing in my office and it works fine for me. 

Is it just me? Am I crazy? i don't get what is so amazing about the Index? 

Anyways, that's my two cents. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - I much prefer the Oculus Rift S over the Valve Index having owned both of them, and will be returning the Index for a refund.",1575694071.0,32,68,196792

Every time I switch it off I am never in the center of the view, it's always to the right of me. If I goto the Steam VR settings, reset my seating view, reset my head view and I am back in the center - the Steam view you see before entering a game with the stars, distant mountains and a grey area at your feet - this grey area is in the center. Run a game, any of the above games I mentioned, and I am back to left of the grey area - so as I look down it's to the right of my view. So, in any of the games, I am either outside the car, outside my ship in ED, outside of any sitting down game.  
Of course, I can't just move to the right because my PC is where I need to be sat at, so a move to the right and I am not sitting at my PC.  
At the moment, the only way out of this is to switch the Guardian system back on, grab a chair and sit directly in the middle, but then my PC is way to the left of me.  
This is just so damn frustrating because one would think that switching OFF the Guardian system would also switch off any need to have a center of anything, the center should always be your headset.

oculus,Nostos First Impressions,"FYI: I never played the beta but heard some pretty bad things from the community and recently from Eric for President. I decided to give it a go anyway.

I played it for \~15-20 excruciating minutes, and then had to stop because it was so unenjoyable. Couldn't run it on high settings--it was a stuttering mess, so I turned it to low. Still a stuttering, janky mess. It's the kind of nauseating thing that VR games often do when they're loading, where a still image flickers rapidly and you become disoriented as you move your head. Let it be known that this game doesn't give you advanced video options. It's just Low-Medium-High.

The first red flag is at the very start, where this little robot thing asks you to calibrate yourself, then asks if you can see yourself in the mirror. It motions at the ground as if to tell the mirror to come up and, as if in an attempt to be funny and charming, the mirror doesn't show up until 10 seconds later. The arms on my girl avatar, according to the mirror, was way off. When I had my hands by my side IRL, the model had its right hand in her body toward the middle.

When you finally enter the game, you get this wrist watch thing ever so slightly reminiscent of what you get from Stormlands but not nearly as functional or just plain good. You can access it sometimes, other times, you can't. I tried changing graphics options from inside the options menu, but couldn't. The only way to do so is to return to the menu screen.

Let's talk about controls/gameplay. Maybe it's just me, but moving around felt like there was some sort of input lag so you end up gliding forward much longer than you want to. To run, you hold the grip which launches you every which way, making it even hard to control where you are. I played as a dude and somehow, some way, without clear directions, ended up in the open wild. Decided to shoot some deer with the pistol they gave me but I had to lead my shots an unreasonable amount. It dropped a slab of meat. Once I ran out of ammo, I had a landmine at my disposal, but it was virtually useless. Two bandits came up to me and started shooting me so I tried to punch them--there was audio feedback, but their HP didn't appear to go down. Once they'd shot me to the ground, one of the npcs game to my aid but started losing the battle, so I was left on the floor to die.

There's no tutorial to speak of, which left me confused about how things worked. That's not a good sign.

Over voice-chat, you can hear people going, ""What the \*\*\*\* is this? How do you do this/that? What's going on? Why is it loading forever?""

For what it's worth, it's a good looking game and from what I saw in the main hub, seems like there's a decent amount of people trying Nostos out too.

But this doesnt feel early-access. This feels early-*early* access.

For those of you who've tried it, what are your thoughts?",1575681615.0,11,11,196791

We released new free DLC for Swords of Gargantua, called Tesseract Abyss!

It's a rogue-lite mode that can be done solo or through multiplayer. Players move downwards into the ""abyss"" fighting in different areas that are chosen from a random selection after each stage.

Along the way you'll earn power-ups, can collect weapons, craft them into stronger weapons and level up your own character's base abilities. There'll even be a shop that appears from time to time which you can buy items (like power-ups and health) through the coin you earn by winning battles.

If you die, you'll carry everything over into the next play minus your initial level. It's pretty tricky so you'll most likely die a few times. Looking forward to seeing everyone progress through it!

I just completed it and I rate it at around a 6/10. It was fine but nothing groundbreaking. A lot of Oculus fans had hyped this game up as the one of the best if not the best VR game but for me, it was a bit boring, very repetitive. 

&amp;#x200B;

Atmosphere was nice but I just didn't feel much. There weren't any instances when I felt like I was having an out of body experience apart from the general locomotion which was all a bit finicky, I felt as if the story was super simple and could have been way more complicated, there were only like 3-4 characters.... 

&amp;#x200B;

Don't get me wrong. Its not bad. Its got a good length for a VR game but for the life of me, I can't see where these 9/10 and 10/10 scores are coming from.",1575752986.0,0,19,196792

I have tried other USB ports, disabled usb power saving, took the battery out for 5 minutes, even replaced the battery and still to no avail.

oculus,How to Narrow Down the Right VR Headset,"For the last week I have been on a VR rampage, getting my hands on several different headsets in order to find the best experience for me. To find the headset I would be willing to live with for the next few years. I had read reviews, did my research, but I felt a lot of the feedback I was hearing was unfocused. People were hesitant to recommend things because things weren't 100% good about any one headset. Conversely, there were many things that people valued far more or less than others. Well, I want to solve that problem by narrowing down use cases. You decide what is most important to you by seeing what scenario fits. This is, of course, from my own perspective.

*You will need to know some basic information about the Steam Index, Oculus Rift S, and Oculus Quest to make sense of this guide.*

**Pre-Requisites:**

What do you need prior to playing VR with the kits below?

* Index: Super Computer. 1080/2080+
* Rift S: Gaming computer. 1060/2060+
* Quest: None. All in one solution.

**Mobility:**

A rating of how easy it is to move your configuration. The wired headsets here are not too difficult to play in seeing as the wires are greatly improved from last gen, so that's less of an issue.

* Index: Dedicated space recommended. Since it uses tracking beacons the best way to get them to work is to mount them. Wires need to be managed regardless of if they are mounted on a wall or a tripod. Moving this system is definitely going to take effort and it's unlikely you will want to move around with this system. If you don't have a dedicated space, or can't see yourself playing in the same space more than 80% of the time, this will be troublesome.
* Rift S: Mobile. The wire is very manageable, and with a dedicated VR laptop (That needs Mini-DisplayPort connected to your GPU) you can be mobile. The headset has all the tracking tools built in, so you are surprisingly mobile. Play downstairs one minute and upstairs the next.
* Quest: Absolute Freedom. VR makes a lot of people conscious and worrisome about the world around them. Well, with the Quest, you have zero wires. It's the future of VR on a general level.

**Comfort:**

* Index: Very comfortable. A little heavy, but felt well balanced. Did not wobble. Best materials.
* Rift S: Comfortable. I would argue very comfortable, but the halo ratchet didn't always feel secure. I did not like the foam as much as the Index's cotton layered padding. Will definitely need Silicone or VR Cover.
* Quest: Comfortable. Most similar to the CV1 in terms of attachment. It requires a lot of fidgeting to get right, but I never had a need for a counter weight once I figured it out. I think people overstress the added ""weight"" as it's only \~70g heavier than the CV1 in the front. It probably helps because it adheres to your face more. There is more wobble on the Quest than the Rift S, but at the same time there are better comfort accessories for the Quest too. If you spend more money the Quest might edge out the Index.

**Visuals:**

* Index: A+. The best visuals I tried. No god rays, just light blooming. Don't be fooled by the fact that it's an LCD because when it comes to VR LCD is king. Don't mistake your monitor's contrast ratio with this thing. Just like TVs have specially adapted pixel configurations to increase contrast (or your iPad for instance), the VR headsets have the same. LCD has less banding, no speckle, and far less SDE. The improved refresh rate of the Index makes it the king of the three. If you get motion sick, the Index is the only headset that may resolve it.
* Rift S: A. Everything above, other than the refresh rate and FOV, applies here. This headset's visuals are not that far off from the Index and that's due to the lenses. The best analogy I can make is a 23"" 1080P monitor and a 27"" 1440P monitor. It's obvious the latter is higher resolution and more dense, but because the 1080P screen is smaller the density is similar (\~97 vs \~109 PPI) the difference isn't mind shattering. The reduced refresh rate is noticeable for owners of the CV1, but it doesn't harm the gaming experience. That being said, I own the 1440p monitor in this example and even though it's only 12 PPI that mattered to me. You might be the same?
* Quest: B. If you've used the CV1, you can think of this as a CV1+. It's unfair to say it isn't different, because text is far easier to read and god rays are greatly reduced, but there are similar OLED issues that remain. SDE is reduced but far more noticeable than the above headsets. Brightness suffers as a result. 72hz is noticeable, but has yet to affect gameplay for me. If you suffer motion sickness this headset might not be for you at all. There isn't jitter, but movement isn't as smooth. Pistol Whip is hard to play compared to on CV1. The B rating is above average though, so we're at a place where visuals aren't something you are suffering through, but simply something better exists.

**Controls:**

I don't think this is a significant talking point. I don't prefer the Oculus controllers versus the old CV1, but they aren't bad. Valve's controllers have additional features but they aren't really necessary in the VR world currently. You're getting a quality controller regardless fo what platform you pick.

**Value:**

* Rift S and Quest are the best value. The Index is a luxury item in my standards. For the money you pay, it delivers. But at some point you are happy with your iPhone X and don't need an iPhone XI. When you buy a Rift S or a Quest you aren't buying yesterday's product either, so there's no sense of ""I wasted money on old tech"". You are buying the newest products that Oculus has to offer. Valve's product is better, but not a better value.

**Sound:**

The Index is the only VR headset with a real audio solution. I'm a little weird in that I like the Rift S' open audio because it allows me to be more aware of my surroundings (and it's immersive because you hear audio without having your ears covered) but that's not the norm. I like it, but I still prefer the Index. Hell, even the CV1's headphones were great and they are missed.

With both the Rift S and the Quest you will need to invest money in another audio solution if you want headsets.

**Quest Link (beta):**

This is specifically for the Quest, but it's usually the most difficult topic regarding getting the Rift S or the Quest. For most people, the lower visual quality of the Quest in Link is worth the mobility and freedom. They just need to make sure Quest Link WORKS.

Quest Link is solid.

If you're playing native Quest apps and you have no issues with the loss of visual fidelity there (due to the mobile processor) and you just want to make sure you can play Half Life: Alyx or some other PCVR titles -- you're good. It works wonderfully for a beta. It's plug and play. The visuals are still great.

However, if you're thinking you want to be playing PCVR more often; if you bought a beefy GPU because you wanted awesome VR graphics and crisp visuals... Quest Link isn't that. It's like playing 1080p games on your 4K monitor. It looks fine, but it's noticeable. 

If you want Quest as a Quest, Link is an added bonus that feels like cheating at life. If you want Quest as some sort of value proposition between your gaming PC and Mobile VR, it's doable without major complaints. If you think Quest Link compares or replaces Rift S/Index in experience however, you're going to be very sorely disappointed. **I have no idea how so many youtubers and reviewers could ever say playing Quest Link felt no different than Rift S.** Just 1 minute in Link and I could easily tell. I'm not some magical gamer -- you'd have to be blind not to know. Whether you care or not is not the same as there being almost no literal difference. That is ***absolute bullshit***.

Perhaps they will fix it in future updates, but Quest Link has slight glitching in visuals every so often. Sometimes objects teleport a few inches (in game perspective) as the stream takes time to catch up during intense gameplay. Vader Immortal's Dojo showed this often when critters would pop up and move around. There's also a very, very slight lag in audio and controllers. I'd say you will never choose to play Beat Saber over Link. Score or Performance didn't drop for me much, but you notice the visual glitches. You will actively recognize that a block sliced open a little closer to your face than you're used to. However, you might be fine playing a game that is intense but not nearly as rapid -- like Stormland or Elder Scrolls VR. Using Half Life as an example again, I can see myself playing it over Link without many complaints.

**What Did I Pick?**

Playing *more* VR supercedes playing *better* VR, in my opinion. This is why I moved on from the CV1 to begin with; the increased visual fidelity was merely an unexpected bonus. While I fell in love with the Valve Index, I don't have a dedicated play area. I have to move between two spots depending on my opportunities so that narrows down my choice. Picking between Rift S and Quest was difficult, but I ended up deciding on the Rift S. Quest is fun without a tether, but I have a gaming laptop and the cord doesn't bother me so much. It feels no different to me than having wired earbuds on.

Happy Holidays and I hope you all find the headset you need!",1575665191.0,15,11,196792
oculus,Oculus Rift S - feeling underwhelmed - what am I missing?,"I hesitate to post a negative thread here but ive been really disapointed with my experience so far.  I've wanted an occulus since they were first announced years ago.  I pulled the trigger on Black Friday. 

So far, the highlight has been the tutorial demo.  I thought that was pretty amazing.  It's been downhill since. 

I installed Steam VR and downloaded one of the free rollar coaster games.  It was kind of cool but didn't feel immersive at all. 

I purchased vorpX and tried a few games. I got maybe two of them to work but again - I was not blown away.  

What am I doing wrong?  Do I pretty much need to only use apps and games purchased through the Oculus store to get the.same.experience that blew me away like the tutorial did?

I hope someone can help give me advice because otherwise this thing is going back to the store.

oculus,Oculus Rift S Headphone Jack Audio Issues,"So ever since I bought the Rift S I've absolutely loved it. I think the one persistent issue I've noticed since opening the Rift S is that my Apple Earpod headphones don't seem to want to sound right unless the jack is sitting in an absolutely specific position often moving back out of position during play which results in audio cutting out of the right headphone.  Sometimes even only plugging it in halfway will give me better audio in both headphones than all the way in which will cut out most of the right headphone unless you twist it just right.

And no, the headphones work perfectly fine in any other device and are not damaged near the jack. The Rift S Headphone Jack is super touchy with jack position. I usually only get this issue with cheap 3.5mm headphone extenders previously. More higher quality 3.5mm extension cords don't have this issue like the current one I'm using for my PC audio into these very headphones that give me issues on the Rift S jack.",1575702097.0,2,2,196792

Upgraded from a HP WMR that had zero FPS issues at 90Hz/FPS, got the rift S and having some problems, mostly at level loads or when something happens in the game (explosions, things spawning, etc) every few minutes.  
I'll get FPS drops and get visually smearing (looks like wet glass) as well as stuttering, even my controllers in game jerk around. CPU and GPU usage seem low at the time it happens.

Ryzen 1400 @ 3.9Ghz (stock vs OC makes no difference)  
16GB 2666Mhz corsair ram  
GTX 980 4GB (stock speeds)

CPU and GPU pass all sorts of benchmarks and dont pass 60C on CPU and 75C on GPU, CPU and GPU usage dont max out in task manager.

But, when I put it on it was just black.  It's connected to USB 3 port and had no problems updating firmware.

I ran the 'Oculus checker' software and my PC meets specs (nvidia GTX1060, 16G ram, USB 3, etc).

Has anyone else had this problem and been able to resolve it? I'm pretty upset that after buying it and making sure my laptop was fine that it's not working.

Edit: not sure why people are down voting this... with the black Friday sales I'm sure other people are likely facing the same issue.

So im in th emarked for a vr headset, and its down between the Quest and the Rift S. The issue is, im not gonna keep my pc in the same room as i would like to VR in. The computer room is to small to do much flailing around, and i dont wanna keep my pc in the living room, because i use it for other stuff besides gaming. So i need about 5-6m extension on the cables. Its also one of the reasons i dont care for the Index, cause id need to run a ton of cabling trough the middle of my apartment. 

Has anyone tried this? Would it be easier to extend the link with an active usb 3 cable? Or the rift S with a display port repeater and some aditional cabling? Would any of those options even work? At this point this seems to be the deciding factor for me, cause they both seem to have a bunch of advantages and disadvantages.

oculus,Don't sleep on Boiling Steel!,"We are suddenly blessed with tons of really good VR content. My library is already a guilt ridden mountain of unfinished games. Recently, we have had some real hard hitters - finding time to play though Asgards Wrath and Stormlands is hard enough. So, this is the first year I passed on the sales - I just do not need any new games. 

Then Boiling Steel comes along. I had my eye on this for some time, saw a couple of enthusiastic reviews (well, 'let's play's'). I thought, 'this game seems legit' - but I stood my ground... no new games 'till I clear some of the back catalogue.

Then I noticed Boiling Steel pop up on Infinity - so I downloaded it. Now I am going to buy it on Steam (Infinity - for me = good for demoing games that I will buy on Steam if I like them). 

Everything about this game puts it up there with the very best VR shooters (perhaps... even my current darling: Stormlands).

Graphics are really, I mean \*really\* good. Gameplay is solid and innovative, and everything about it just 'feels right'. 

There is a very different feel to most shooters (VR or not). You see, there are no health packs lying around (if you think about it - having convenient health packs just lying around - is pretty dumb, unrealistic and immersion breaking in any game). *Here* you have to conserve your health - get though by playing smart and taking as few hits as possible. Dash, forward to hit, or dash back to evade - fight more tactically. This gives the game some genuine tension and sense of achievement. There is no - 'I'll kill this guy, pick up his health pack and suddenly, I am 100% again'. 

The only bad thing so far is the voice acting - the main GI Joe voice is like fingernails on a blackboard. But that's it - everything else is up there with the very best. 

Putting this game out now is poor timing - had this come out before AW and Stormlands - I am pretty sure everyone would be flagging it up - and I fear many will pass, or not even notice what is a truly great game.

I current have a wide open setup at home and I use pure white LED bulbs in my light fixture and my setup has an abundant amount of light. Is there anything else I can do to help improve the tracking for the touch control?

Owned an Oculus for about a year and I love it. My current system runs a heavily modded Skyrim VR smooth as butter but recent games like Asgards Wrath and Stormlands are starting to have issues so I'm thinking it's time to upgrade. Problem is, I'm not sure what. My PC has basically been hammered together over several years, I'm not even really sure what's in there at this point but a system scan tells me I'm running:

Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-6700K CPU @ 4.00GHz 

Radeon RX Vega 

16 GB DDR3 RAM

Windows 10 64bit

So my question is, what to upgrade ? I'd rather go heavy in one or two areas rather than a little boost across the board. I'm budgeting about £500 and I'd like to put in an SSD to improve loading times ( especially for Asgards wrath my 2 year old 2TB drive really doesn't like loading that game ) but should I go for more RAM or a faster CPU ? I could get a new graphics card but the Vega is only about a year old and should handle stuff pretty well.

so yeah. An SSD and what ? 64gig of ram or a fancy new processor ?

No Man's Sky has exhibited some noticeable issues on my W10 system, which consists of:

i5 6600k (Stock)
Sapphire Nitro+ 5700XT 8GB OC
16gb DDR4 

Based on some light research, NMS in VR is very CPU intensive due to the nature of the game itself, which matches up with the issues I've had (slow to render/black portion of view when quickly moving head, stuttering when moving at high speed, and during star field intro/loading screen).

In search of a solution, I'm debating which upgrade path is the best and most cost effective for my predicament. The i7 7700k is the fastest CPU my LGA1151 board will accommodate. Can I expect this to provide a noticeable boost and the alleviation of these issues, or should I spend some more for a new AM4 motherboard with a Ryzen 3800x?

Mostly looking for opinions and first hand experience from those with a 7700k. Would I be wasting money taking that route? Also, maybe someone has a tweak in mind for NMS that makes a difference?

It worked perfectly fine before but now it doesn't so if you are using DK2 be weary about updating.

I tried Microsoft verifier, sfc scannow, memtest, checked drive for errors etc... No issues anywhere. It doesn't matter what cable I connect to the sensor, it just BSOD the moment the sensor turns on (config window or in-game) but does appear to work for a brief second.

oculus,360 degree video app that allows perspective change via controller in addition to head movement?,"I have an Oculus Go, I'm a very casual VR user, and I've been taking more and more 360 video since getting my Gear 360. Often I want to view this content in bed, on the couch, etc. where there are kinda constraints on moving around enough to see from any perspective. I say ""kinda"" because of course I \*could\* get up and move around, I just don't wanna, it's more effort than I want to expend.

The same thing would occur if you wanted to use the headset in an airplane seat. I imagine you'd have less than 180 degrees of head movement, you could become a pain to your seat neighbors pretty quickly. For a lot of casual content, even some games (i.e. Eclipse, Monument Valley), being able to control the perspective from the controller would be nice.

It's surprised me that almost no apps (that I've encountered so far) allow perspective change like this from the controller also.

What would be REALLY nice is some way at the system level of the Go to enable this sort of override for any/all content. This has to exist already, right? If a physically impaired user wants to use a headset, granted the immersion will suffer a bit, but this seems like a perfectly acceptable tweak to the navigation model.

The one exception to this I've seen so far is the Netflix app, in the mode where the ersatz room disappears (void?). I like that to occasionally watch video laying flat in bed. It's not exactly what I'm describing, but it feels close, at least in spirit.",1575647283.0,2,2,196792

Short version is that my first headset was quite simply, defective. The cable connection at the headset was extremely finicky and if you turned slightly it would disconnect. I plugged it back in multiple times, tried different display ports, different USB ports, even a powered USB hub, nothing worked. I also had the issue where my headset would occasionally stop tracking my hands and they would lock in place.

So after many hours troubleshooting, I returned it and ordered another. Got it today and works awesome! No issues setting up or with tracking, no black outs/ shutting off, and the connection to the headset is firm.

It's an absolute blast to get to play with a rift s that actually works lol. For anyone wondering, I play robo recall, Pavlov, and blade and sorcery.

oculus,(Rift S)Can we talk about this - Oculus Software Restart Required,"Many of you may have seen or heard about this issue, many others, like myself, may be one of the victims. If you have not heard about this issue, it is a problem that plagues primarily the Rift S from what I can tell. The problem seems to arise after a PC reboot after setting up the Rift S for the first time. When the Oculus Software starts, a notification appears on the Devices tab showing an issue with the Rift S. Clicking on the Rift S shows a message which says ""Oculus Software Restart Required"". Restarting all of the Oculus Software and services does not fix this message no matter how many times it is done, and the headset is unusable when in this state (black screen).

A quick Google search for Oculus Rift S Software Restart Required will reveal dozens of posts on various forums detailing this issue dating all the way back to late March and early June, right around the Rift S release. All of the many posts I've seen are filled with conjecture, hypotheses, and mundane troubleshooting steps which leave users in no better shape and no real answers. Some think it's due to USB driver versions, some think it's a power draw issue, some think it's an Oculus Software bug (my opinion), others think it's due to outdated graphics drivers or windows updates, but no one really knows. This issue has been affecting many users since launch, and the lack of any official statement by Oculus is concerning to say the least.

I'd like to hear from those of you who may have experienced this problem. If you created an Oculus Support ticket, what was the provided solution? Did the provided solution fix the issue? Did you try any troubleshooting yourself? Did any of those steps fix the issue? When did you start experiencing this, and what are the symptoms?

For the record, I love gun controllers for games. I have the PS Sharpshooter for PS3 (Killzone 3 is fantastic with it). I even have a MAG II gun for PC and I experimented with wiimotes https://youtu.be/8OcXppjEgi8 and https://youtu.be/GyYm1s6y4RY. I got the PS4 Pro and the PSVR mainly for the aim controller. For VR I have the standard ProTube.

First some thoughts on PSVR and Farpoint. What can I say, apart from the fixed IPD (blurry edges with my 70mm IPD), having those early-game spidery things in Farpoint jump at me in a headcrab-like arc really gave me a chill down the spine. I have not felt that recently. And splashing them mid-air with the aim controller was such fun! For some reason, the robotic spiders in Robo Recall do not elicit the same primal reaction.

The haptics on the aim controller are quite good and really bring that feeling of actually holding and shooting a gun. Unfortunately, with the ProTube I get almost no haptics. The vibrations of the Touch controllers are very, very weak and they are even less noticeable when the touch controllers are in the ProTube cups.

So I have a question: does the ForceTube work well? Does it work in all games? How does it compare to other controllers like the PSVR aim controller and the PS Sharpshooter?",1575618283.0,1,0,196792

oculus,CV1 to Rift S - First Impressions,"I have tried the Rift S before briefly, and wasn’t sure about the comfort, but my wife got me one for Black Friday, so here are my impressions.  I am a 67-68 IPD

Also, to qualify this, I last used my Rift CV1 a couple days ago and won’t be able to use it again until next week (for reasons) so I can’t compare them directly.

Visual Quality

Awesome.  Huge improvement over the CV1.  The SDE is still there, but vastly improved and often not noticeable.  I thought the colors were just fine despite it not being an OLED.  I didn’t try it in Elite Dangerous or another super dark game though.  Clarity around the screen was great too.  Couldn’t get both eyes 100% focused but seemed clear when using it.  It did seem very slightly off though, hard to explain, I think because my IPD is too wide?  Not enough to notice 90% of the time, the the visuals were a huge bump up.
As for God Rays, they are massively reduced.  You can still see streaks of light from high contrast objects, but they are much fainter and softer, just a slight smear of light.

Comfort

The halo was comfortable once I got it set up.  The only drawback was it seemed like it took a lot more fiddling with it when I put it on.  The CV1 I could just slip on.

Tracking

Amazing.  I was expecting a slight downgrade from the CV1, but honestly it seemed as good or better.  I was sword fighting in Until You Fall (unrelated note, every one in awhile that game pauses with the hourglass figure, anyone know how to fix that?) and had zero problems.  Same with Robo Recall.  The setup was simple too.  

Audio

Ok, this is a downgrade.  Not as bad as I  feared (my previous demo was in a noisy store so couldn't tell then) but it is still a downgrade.  Not horrible though, you can still hear clearly.

Eye Strain

In a previous post I mentioned that I felt the Rift S caused some eye strain for me when I demoed it.  I spent some time trying different fittings to reduce that.  But after playing awhile, I am still feeling it.  I didn’t have this problem with the CV1.  I think it is just the price I will have to pay for a wider IPD.

I will update this next week after I have had more time to play and have my CV1 hooked up again to compare side by side.

Update 1 - I was asked about blurriness at the edges of the lens.  I don't think it is bad.  I mean yes it gets distorted when you look at the far edge of the lense, but it has a big sweet spot where it is very clear to look around with your eyes.",1575570028.0,8,21,196792

oculus,Rift S - Need for cover / VR Cover use?,"Hello,

Like many, I recently got an Oculus Rift S on black friday, and trying to be a perfectionist about it looked for accessories for it. I was disappointed to see that there weren't a lot of options on the market. I ordered the AMVR grips, which I will hopefully not regret (I barely saw other options here either), but the one thing I heard people talking about is that you should use a washable cover for the Rift S due to hygiene reasons. On further research I have seen that the one offered by VR Cover (which I heard was the best for these kind of things) for the Rift S was just a simple cloth you strap over. 

&amp;#x200B;

For the price it costs, it would cost just as much to just get a replacement headplate for the Rift S in case I needed one - and the VR Cover one also has basically no reviews to be found anywhere online. So I'm asking here: Anyone with experience - is the VR Cover worth it and are there better alternatives or other must-have accessories to further improve the care of my new (and first) VR headset.

oculus,Day One with Rift S. :),"Well, today I finally, after waiting like 5 years to get a headset, got the Rift S.

I also got the Sapphire Nitro+ 5700XT.

I've only used the headset for a few hours, around 6, and everything seems to be working great.

I played First Step, it has you push buttons on the controller, but there is a long delay between each scripted event, it kept making me think the thing had froze.  The desk comes out of the floor, and you have cubes to play with. Throw a paper airplane, and play with ping pong paddle and ball.

Then I noticed that it was awfully quiet, there was no sound. So I wanted to take the headset off, and decided to put the controllers on the desk in front of me, till I remember it wasn't real. LOL! Almost dropped them on the floor! Yikes!

The little flying robot felt like he was there, like I could reach out and touch him! Very cool!

When I first put the headset on, I was sitting down, and I started the wrong game, I meant First Step, but played the next one after that one. The floor was wrong, and I was up near the ceiling. I wanted to stand up, and get in place in my room, but there was equipment around my head, and it seemed so real, that my brain was telling me not to stand up, your going to smash your face into that. LOL!!! Unreal!

Anyway, after I took a break for food, and looked up some info, and then installed Steam VR. Very easy to do.

I had bought Space Pirate Trainer, a game I've been wanting to play for years now. :) Took all of about 2 mins to install Steam VR, and Space Pirate Trainer, and I was playing. Very smooth. I had less trouble with Steam, than Home. In Home, I couldn't find a way to recenter my view, so I had to face odd directions to play. Steam, made it very easy. 

Great game, the tracking is awesome. The guns in my hand seemed real, because they followed my every movement, as fast as I was moving them. I was holding the shield with the controller like under my chin, hiding behind the shield, and never lost tracking, I never lost tracking since I got the headset for that matter! :) Oh, and I played the whole time lying on my back!! :) I was tired, long day. :) Worked great though.

Then I used the Virtual Desktop in Home to watch a YouTube video. I made the screen huge. Video quality was great, like no screen door effect at all. Much better than I thought. I honestly never read anyone say how good the picture was, they always seemed disappointed.... After seeing it for myself, I don't understand their reaction.

People complain about the blacks, and the sound. The blacks are black enough, they aren't perfect, but very far from being a game breaker, and the sound is good, nice 3D Spatial audio, no you don't get hard bass, but you get a bit, I can live with it.

Zero motion sickness. I'm farsighted, and had zero trouble seeing with the Rift S. My eyes never got tired.

Computer Stats:
950watt Power supply, was running two GTX 480's, that's what I just upgraded from. :)
3770K CPU
Sapphire Nitro+ 5700XT 3 times faster than my 480's. :)
32gigs of ram
Inateck Superspeed 7 Ports PCI-E to USB 3.0 Expansion Card KT5002 using the far left port, if you're facing the back of your computer.

Make sure you usb ports power save is disabled. I had done it, but for some reason, it turned back on. Which caused the screen to go black, I had put the headset down for a few minutes, and wouldn't wake up when I put the headset back on. Had to reboot, this happened a couple of times, after that I rechecked those settings, and had to turn them off again....

Question, how do you watch a video, without hearing the crackling fire in Oculus Home the whole time?

So far, the Rift S has been great. Hopefully it remains that way. Need to get some sleep. :) Long day of VR tomorrow. :)",1575525830.0,28,22,196792

The game is going to be pulled off the old account and uploaded there. A bit of an administrative workaround but we're looking forward to the future!  The old (Russia registered) account and Steam page will no longer be active. The new Steam page is going be available as soon as it finished. We will post another announcement by that time.

oculus,"Best options for headset, Oculus Rift S","Alright so, I've been getting into VRChat pretty heavy recently, been having a good time. What's not a good time is every time I meet someone new they bitch and moan about my audio quality from the mic, and how it intermittently ""roboticizes"" and is just generally poor quality and makes unpleasant noises on its own accord. This has been ruining my experiences. So, since I'm also looking to supplement the also very poor speakers of the rift S, which honestly at this point are less of a bother than the even poorer mic, I figured the best way to do that is to buy a wireless combo headset. With that said, i tried the ps4 ones that my brother had and they were super loose and did not cup the ears well and wanted to fall off anytime I was playing something active. So, what have people had good luck with. I'm looking for something that foremost, snugly holds the ears and has good audio quality, as well as good mic quality. Now that I think about it, battery life is a big one too. I have been known to play for up to 6-7 hours at a time now that I have gotten my VR legs so it would be nice to not go mute halfway through. I do believe with the rift s the only way to achieve this is wireless since they didn't implement a mic input, so I suppose that's a necessity too. Ideally under $200 but I'm willing to fudge the price a little bit.",1575522561.0,5,2,196792

oculus,CV1 to Quest (PC) first impressions [Technical and experience],"So having just gotten an Oculus Quest after a few months with a dead launch-day OG Rift I'm thrilled to be joining the virtual worlds again, also bare in mind that until my 3m Usb-C cable gets here in a few days I was using a 0.5m cable.

Setup was really easy. On my AMD R9 3900x system which uses an AMD Radeon 5700XT GPU and Gigabyte X570 ITX motherboard there were absolutely no problems whatsoever, it's simply one cable with no dicking about with sensors or the convoluted setup process. I had no issues getting the headset connected and it booted right into Home without any complaints or hickups. Here are the first things I noticed visually...   
   
The **field of view**, it is FAR less boxy and much to my surprise it is noticably **wider** than my OG Rift, I had heard mixed reports of this with some saying the field of view felt narrower, well I can confirm that this isn't the case and I can see more both horizontally and vertically, this is the first thing I noticed and I had tested this by standing on the balcony of my Home and looking out over the mountains (something I did a lot) and immediately it felt like I could both see more, and further - it's a noticable upgrade!   
   
Next were the **colours**, all colors seemed brighter with darker shades being far more uniform and 'black' than on my OG Rift, there were no tints or maura artefacts. Everything felt more alive, I can see any games based in space are going to be a real treat to play on this!   
   
Now onto **resolution**, I was expecting the edges to have that wierd pixelation effect you often see in screenshots from Quest games, I did not see any of this, I looked hard for compression artefacts and could find none (I spent a good hour trying to pick them out, I could not), the resolution is noticably higher than on the OG Rift most likely helped by the higher resolution panels inside the headset, while the screen-door effect is still present if you look for it, it is a big improvement over the OG Rift, I noticed I could see the photos I have imported onto my wall much clearer from further away and could pick out details easily.   

The **lenses** are a big improvement over the OG Rift, there is still some god-rays but they seem far less distracting and the sweet-spot is much bigger, I can look to the edges and still easily read text and pick out details, the lenses seem larger and set further back meaning that someone with glasses will have an easier time using this headset.  

**Tracking** definetly feels 'better', the blind spots are 'static' and relative to me, rather than having to 'guess' where they are due to the placement of the sensors. The controllers worked just fine while waving them around like a muppit and even moving them out of my sightline didn't seem to cause them to drop out.

Finally comfort, I used to find the OG rift not that comfortable after an hour of usage and would get ""Rift face"", I personally actually find the Quest to be more comfortable than the OG Rift here.

tl;dr: It's better in every way than the OG Rift with the added bonus of being able to take it with you and hop into VR on the go",1575492049.0,17,33,196792

I'm getting a Rift S for Christmas and am getting a little nervous. I've always been super excited for VR and I remember my mind being blown seeing the DK1 playing TF2 videos. I've never had the chance to try VR, all VR demo's are far away and I don't know anyone with it. I know there are some people on youtube with lower IPD's like VR Oasis and I've seen posts of people on reddit saying despite their low IPD they're fine, while others saying it's absolutely nauseating and there's no way to get used to it.

oculus,Rift S impressions from a CV1/DK2 user’s perspective,"When the Rift S was announced I admit I was a bit meh about it. The resolution bump and longer cable looked nice, but losing OLED and the rather nice audio solution of the CV1 just didn’t seem worth it. But then of course Black Friday took £50 off the price and it seemed like the right time to dive in and see how it is.

First impressions out of the box were mixed. The headset itself definitely feels high quality. The materials used are very good, especially the plush cushion on the inside of the halo. It just seemed a bit bulky compared to the CV1 thanks to the halo. I expected it to be much heavier than it was when I lifted it out of the box. Likewise the new controllers are a big improvement in materials, they feel fantastic in your hand.

The setup experience was a bit of a pain for no reason I could see. The mandatory headset firmware upgrade seemed like it had stuck and spent a worrying amount of time just sitting there doing not very much. There definitely needs to be better feedback to the user while that’s going on. And then I got the dreaded sensors can’t track error. Unplugging and replugging the USB cable as suggested had no effect, but a quick reboot seemed to do the trick.

Popping the headset on for the first time I was hugely surprised at just how comfortable and easy to secure it is. There’s no pressure on your face at all, the weight seems perfectly evenly distributed by the halo. Once secured it doesn’t wiggle or move about.

&amp;nbsp;

As soon as the screens activated the improvements over the CV1 display were evident. I was hugely sceptical of the claims of vastly reduced/no screen door but it’s absolutely true. If anything it feels like a bigger leap than going from DK2 to CV1 did. I had to keep my head absolutely still and really hunt for signs of pixels. It’s a huge improvement because everything looks and feels far more solid and much less like you’re looking through a mesh at a screen. God rays are indeed hugely reduced or eliminated. I noticed some shimmer around white text on a black background on a Wolves in the Walls loading screen, but nothing anywhere else.

Text on the Oculus UI is crystal clear, and Virtual Desktop is a joy. The ‘sweet spot’ is definitely far bigger and you can really look around with your eyes to see stuff clearly without having to move your head to get things legible. Watching videos with the reduced screen door and better pixel density  is a far more enjoyable experience, whether in Virtual Desktop, Big Screen or 3D SBS/180 content.

Firing up Elite Dangerous and DCS it was clear that legibility of text and instruments is vastly better, Especially in DCS. The inky not-quite-black of space (I never messed with SPUD) is still there but it looks significantly smoother with less obvious blocky gradients. Colours are great, contrast is not noticeably any worse than CV1 and it all looks superb. I haven’t noticed any detriment to the step down to 80hz refresh rate.

&amp;nbsp;

Which was when I realised that the tracking was just working perfectly. I’d not really thought about it, but the inside-out tracking does indeed work as advertised. In the few hours I’ve spent in the headset I’ve had no issues at all, even in a poorly lit room with a flashing Christmas tree at the other end. If I hadn’t known better I’d not have been able to tell it apart from the CV1 tracking set up, except now I have more bits of my room I can use as I can go in part of the room that I couldn’t cover with sensors before.

&amp;nbsp;

So audio. This surprised me. It’s actually really nice not to have anything on your ears and the sound is really not bad. It’s not great, but it’s spacious and very natural, even if it does lack bass. Sadly I’ll rarely get to use it that way as my PC is in the living/dining room and even on CV1 I was always getting told to turn it down. And that’s where the headphone jack really shines, because I can finally fully isolate the outside world from my VR audio. What I haven’t settled on is which headphones are best to use. My ATH-M50x headset fits over the halo, just, but it all gets a bit painful if I want to just slip the headset off quickly. Some AKG in-ear buds worked much better in practical terms, but at the cost of losing the spacious nature of the sound. In the end I’m a bit torn on this and I’m not sure if I’d rather have the CV1 audio solution back or not.

&amp;nbsp;

The other big addition which I was a bit meh about initially was pass through. It just didn’t seem to offer that much practical value. Until I realised that it automatically activates if you put your head through the guardian boundary. And that is really cool. It is quite handy to be able to double-click the oculus button and activate to check where you are without having to try and squint through the reduced (but not eliminated) nose gap.

That Oculus button on the right remote though. That needs a rethink. I know I’ll get used to it but I must have accidentally hit it at least five or six times and it’s just a nuisance.

&amp;nbsp;

So how do I feel about it overall? I think it’s pretty great. The downsides aren’t nearly as down as they might seem on  paper, and the improvements in the screen and lenses over the CV1 are spectacular. Virtual worlds now feel far more solid and substantial, and the extra comfort of the halo design means I can spend much longer enjoying them. I may even have re-kindled my love of VR all over again, which I genuinely didn’t expect.",1575455760.0,51,43,196792

oculus,"""Headset Sensor Tracking"" stuck for my new Oculus Rift S, haven't heard back from Oculus support and hoping you guys have other ideas on how I can fix this problem so I don't have to return my headset","**""Headset Sensor Tracking""** is the problem spot I can't get past.

So I unboxed it Sunday and had some difficulty getting started. Oculus software installed just fine, so I started the setup. I thought I had to have everything plugged in before I got there, so after it wouldn't connect I disconnected, restarted and tried again. After quite some time, the setup finally got past ""Headset Sensor Tracking"" and I was able to hook up the touch controllers and play.

It wasn't perfect, but it worked for a few hours Sunday night. I did the tutorial with the robot in the trailer, played around in Home, then figured out how to play Elite Dangerous. I didn't know you could hold down the Oculus button to reset the look in front of you, so I messed around with redrawing the guardian boundary so I could sit in my desk chair and play with it in front of me (knowing about the buttons now makes that 20 minutes of futzing with the boundary funny). Played it for about 20 minutes before bed (it took me several hours to get it going) and stopped.

The next day, I couldn't get it to read. I've got [my logs through last night here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1K-tI-jjVi4OKT8785p1TV4Fc3mvdL8UQ/view?usp=sharing), and it looks like the USB port isn't reading the headset. So I tried a number of things:

* *Change Advanced Power Settings*: **Disabled** USB selective suspend setting
* *Device Manager &gt; USB Controllers &gt; R-Click* ‘**Rift S USB Hub**’ and unchecked  ‘Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power’
* *Tried every USB port:* I have tried plugging the USB into every port I have on the machine, including the 2.0 slots. Every time, I unplug the Display Port cable and plug it back in 10-20 seconds after plugging in the USB.
* *Tried plugging in minimal other cables*: I read that it may not draw enough power if other stuff is plugged in with it. Didn't work when it was only cable plugged in any of the 6 USB ports.
* *Tried reseating the headset cable*: it was plugged in strongly before, but I reseated the cable and made sure to be careful plugging it back in.
* *Updated Windows 10*: No change
* *Updated drivers for GPU, MoBo, CPU:* No change
* *Uninstalled and reinstalled Oculus software*: No change

I have tried some other things, but they aren't coming to mind right now as I sit at work. I did order [this PCIe card](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00B6ZCNGM/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) on Monday night, but that isn't going to arrive at my house until Friday. Judging by the log, I'm guessing it's got to be that the USB ports on my MoBo aren't getting enough power to the headset, but the *audio* works perfectly fine - I've left the headset plugged in after trying to connect, and then played some Final Fantasy XI only to hear the audio coming from the headset.

If anyone has any ideas, I'll include my PCPartPicker parts list to show all the stuff in it.

I had a chat with Oculus Support, and after going through my logs they can't understand what's wrong. They're going to get back to me in another couple days (3-4 business) after reading my logs and I can't tell you how bothersome it is to finally get on the phone with someone whose job it is to fix your problems and they can't do any better than you.

I also got the PCIe card and installed it tonight...reads other USB stuff but not the Rift. So I'm wondering if it's not the cord itself. Other ports have worked with it though, so idk what the solution is. I'm pretty discouraged.",1575494846.0,4,12,196792

I been thinking about ""What if i just bring him a quest""..

 

Im curious if anyone thinks the Quest would be a decent source of ""big screen"" entertainment?   I got a rift s and think its awesome, Ive messed with bigscreen and virtual desktop.

If anyone has a solution I don't know about, I'm all ears, nothing I've found has helped so far.

I just purchased an Oculus Rift S over black friday and have been having a few issues, mainly when trying to pair the Oculus touch controllers. Everything works up until ""Pairing Left Controller"". Pressing menu + Y takes way longer than it should to make the light blink. It tries for 30 seconds or so before saying ""unable to pair"". It then disconnects the headset via USB 3 cable (though the cable itself stays connected) and the controller flashes fast in an S.O.S. style for minutes afterward. The headset cannot find the controller afterwards.

I have attempted disconnecting all other USB devices, running the driver through the support tab (which fixed another issue I had), and reconnecting both cables as the controller pairs. I have double checked the batteries as well.

Some things to note: Yesterday the headset made a quiet hissing/coil whine noise, which has since stopped (I read that was normal until guardian was set up but I haven't gotten that far). The headset light has gone from white to yellow a few times but it fixes itself immediately.",1575479737.0,8,6,196792
oculus,Brass Tactics and The Unspoken are freakin amazing!,"So, after 6 months absolutely loving my Quest, and drooling over the expansive library of PCVR games, I finally just got a pc to use with a Link. There have been a few games particularly that I’ve had my eye on which really helped push me over the edge on buying the PC.

Now, finally, after months of watching gameplay videos and reviews I finally have them (well almost all of them) and let me just say I am not disappointed!

Brass Tactics is just the most accessible, intuitive and downright fun game, such a refreshing change of pace from all the pew pew. Don’t get me wrong, I love a good shooter, but I like to have a diverse library that covers a bunch of different gaming moods, and this fills a massive hole in my VR experience. If you’re on the fence on this one then I strongly recommend you try the free “Arena” version. 

The Unspoken is similar, in that it offers something different from a lot of other games, and what it offers is an absolute blast! Admittedly, I’ve only just got it and played through about an hour of the story mode, so I can’t comment on AI opponents or multiplayer, but what I’ve played so far has made me grin from ear to ear. I can’t wait to unlock all the different character classes, skill up and head into battle. So much fun!

Next on my list is In Death and Arizona Sunshine, but I want to take my time with these two before I jump to the next ones.

For all the new to PCVR people out there, what are the games that are blowing your minds? And to all the veterans, what are the games that you think the noobs should be rushing to get?",1575451782.0,30,32,196792
oculus,Is PCVR worth the jump.,I had no experience with VR until 2 weeks ago I bought myself a oculus quest. I love it since buying I have not touched my PS4 pro or Xbox One X I have just played my quest. I only have 3 real gripes with my quest one is the graphics. Although they are not terrible I want the most visually stunning VR experience. However in order to get that I would need to invest in a valve index rift s or vice pro. My second complaint is a lot of the VR seem like 1-3 hour experiences and I come from playing 50 hour open world campaign style games. Lastly is the game library although it has options it’s limited compared to the options I would have on PC. I have been considering building a PC for a while and now I’m thinking this might be the time with VR. However my question is for anyone that has PCVR is it a groundbreaking experience coming from a quest? My only fear is I spend 4-6k in building a gaming PC monitors desk chair upgrading my VR system and it’s just only a slight or not a huge 1000s of dollar better upgrade. I understand value is subjective because we all make different money. I am fortunate enough where I can afford to upgrade and spend the 4-6k for everything but I only want to do it if it’s truly worth it. I understand so much of this is subjective but I would really appreciate if anyone has any experience that could compare or give any advice I really do appreciate it.,1575516860.0,1,31,196792

oculus,"Getting the best performance to visual compromise, No Man's Sky VR, simple guide","I wrote this as a comment in another thread but I thought people may like to see it, and I was playing some more today after tinkering a lot the other day with settings, and was feeling confident about my suggestion.

With the various patches to NMS VR, a lot of the ideas put forward in older guides soon after the VR release aren't as applicable. I don't have the technical knowledge to tell you what kinds of little things you can try to squeeze the most juice out of your computer when playing NMS VR, but I did do a bunch of experimenting and determined what graphical settings should be prioritised for the best aesthetic, immersive experience imHo.

This guide is only effective for computers above a certain threshhold of power. Mine is an RTX 2070.

The short of it: prioritise super sampling over in-game graphical setting improvements. To a point. 

The in-game settings I will provide are based off testing where I feel these settings provide the most impact for the least resources. Further increases don't create substantial aesthetic benefit, but further downgrades result in pretty big negative aesthetic result. The guide starts with these settings, no more, no less, follow them exactly (if your computer can't run these settings at regular 1x resolution then I would ignore this guide T_T):

**Texture Quality**: High

**Animation Quality**: Ultra (depends on your CPU, because this setting uses CPU only)

**Shadow Quality**: Enhanced

**Post Processing**: High

**Volumetric Effects**: Standard

**Terrain Tesselation**: Standard (off)

**Planet Quality**: Standard

**Base Qaulity**: ...I haven't spent time around bases yet, so I'm not sure. I have it set to High for now.

**Anisotropic Filtering**: 2

**Anti Aliasing**: Off/none

**GBAO**: Off

Okay, in-game settings done.

**Go to Steam VR settings. Check the box to disable ASW (in the ""Applications"" tab).**

**After that, also in the Applications tab, just adjust your Super sampling as high as you can without losing that solid framerate (you want your game staying in the green of that little live display of your refresh rate).** If you can go higher than 200%, I'd stop there and start bumping graphics settings again.

But damn, 200% is beautiful. I can't run it at 80fps with 2x on my setup, but I tried it for a bit just to see and it's gorgeous. The super sampling makes a much bigger difference in NMS than any of those graphical settings past what I listed, imo.

On my system if I want to achieve 80fps I have to stick closer to 100% resolution. :'( I'm in the process of deciding whether I'd rather run smooth at 80fps or keep the super sampling nice and high and suffer the consequences...

If your computer can't handle those baseline in-game graphic settings, I would lower the graphics settings before lowering resolution below 100%. Shit gets rough. A big part of No Man's Sky is that beauty, and at some point that gets lost amidst the noise when the resolution isn't high enough.

If you do reach 200% at a comfortable, stable fps, imo the first thing you would want to increase after that is Anisotropic filtering. Anywhere up to and including the max 16. before prioritising something else. This will get everything just a little crisper and more detailed from a distance, which again I feel is one of the more impactful aesthetic changes you can make in NMS VR. Turning on something like Terrain Tesselation or GBAO is nice, but rather than being an aesthetic improvement, I feel that it's more of an aesthetic DIFFERENCE. So unless you're REALLY attached to the look of one of those, you don't really lose anything turning them off, and I wouldn't prioritise them (they seem to take up a lot of resources I think).

Hope that helps some people enjoy it!",1575430399.0,46,21,196792

For some reason it doesn't influence Oculus home that much, but when you run a game, even natively like Space Pirate Trainer or Catan VR you can notice it.

oculus,Rift S review after 6 months,"I purchased my first VR headset (Rift S) this summer and it has mostly been a blast. I've introduced family members and friends to VR, which has probably been the best part of the experience for me. Watching them pop into First Steps/Contact and Beat Saber for the first time has probably been one of the best gaming experiences of my life. I've finally been able to bond over games with the people in my life who don't normally play games at all. My girlfriend and I have put in a ton of hours on Beat Saber, the game is great and the mod community makes it amazing. Normally I have no interest in rhythm games but this one has definitely been the exception. I've also had a bit of fun with the archery range in The Lab, Superhot VR, and the lightsaber dojo in Vader Immortal.

All those nice things said, I really wish I could get more out of my VR experience and play some more intense games. Sadly, every time I've tried I've ended up regretting it. I've attempted a number of others (mostly Lone Echo, Pavlov VR, Onward, Blade &amp; Sorcery). I've got plenty of others in my library to try as well since I purchased the summer sale game packs on both the Oculus store and on Steam.

What's preventing me from wanting to even try is motion sickness (or virtual reality sickness, which I suppose is more accurately the lack of motion, confusing the brain). I've tried a lot of advice mentioned here. Marijuana, ginger tea, frequent breaks, slowly working my way up and trying to build a resistance. I'm always done by my first break. I start feeling it as soon as I load into these games. My IPD is slightly above the recommendation for the Rift S (69) but I don't think that's too impactful. And it's not just me, everyone whom I've had test my headset while playing a game with movement/""moderate comfort"" level has reported the same feelings of dizziness and nausea. This really makes me wonder what people are talking about on the sub when they claim to have overcome these problems, or never had them to begin with. I've only extensively tested it on myself, but I've yet to meet anyone who doesn't experience nausea or claim it doesn't bother them.

Because of this, I've preferred to stick to my 2D world of gaming and declare my VR headset a $400 Beat Saber machine, and nifty toy for social gatherings. While I did really enjoy my short play sessions of other games in the moment, it's just not worth the horrible regret afterward.",1575447057.0,10,56,196792

I just received my Rift S headset, loving it so far (aside from getting a bit woozy playing some intense games). My IPD is about 64-65, which seems perfect for the Rift S. This is great as I will be the primary user of this; it looks perfect. My girlfriend, who is not a gamer, has an IPD of 57 or so. I let her try the headset yesterday and it amazed her, even at the default IPD of 64. I figured next go around I would try to set it to what works best for her. Does anyone have experience using the Rift S with a software IPD set to the high 50's (56-59)? She won't be using the headset often, or for long periods, but i'd like to tweak it to give her the best experience possible.",1575469697.0,2,7,196792

oculus,Oculus vs SteamVR,"HI,

My quest arrived last night and I'm pretty impressed. Tried a couple of native demos and it reminds me of WII games. In a good way, that the sheer fun and immersion makes me forget the simple cartoony graphics. Why waste money on graphics cards when its this good.

Oh yeah.

I want to play PC games. So, after a bit of messing about I finally managed to get the only VR PC game I own running. Dirt Rally 2.0.

But knowing the Quest was coming I bought Elite in the Steam sale (I already have it on Commodore 64, Atari ST and PS4!). When looking into how to get Dirt Rally running (I thought that as it has an Oculus mode I just selected that) I found a lot of complaints about the steam version not supporting Oculus API and wonder if this is a real issue.

Should I refund Steam Elite while I can and pay 4x the price for the Oculus version? What about future games? Should I buy from the Oculus store where possible?

Do other games on Steam support Oculus natively? I did try launching a VR benchmark app from Steam before I knew I had to install SteamVR and it just worked.",1575469044.0,2,4,196792
oculus,VR looks better on my laptop even though my desktop is a better machine,"So I have been using my Rift S on my desktop since I got it but now I wanted to take my headset with me so I set it up on my laptop as well. The thing that struck me was how sharp Beatsaber looks on my laptop and how smooth it runs compared to the desktop and I have no idea why that is.

My desktop is i9-9900k, rtx 2080, 16GB ram and the laptop is a i7-something, rtx2060, 16gb ram. Both run windows 10 and both are up to date. The laptop has a fresh install of oculus and beat saber but that shouldnt matter should it?

Also the laptop has lower res on the screen u at  1920×1080 but that should not impact the visuals on the headset as far as I know. I also noticed that everythin looked smaller and lower down in beatsaber with the laptop. The boxes were smaller and closer to the ground.

At home I played games like gorn and budget cuts where audio doesn't really matter and was having a blast, then when I got Beat Saber I was shocked by how truly terrible the audio was, basically unplayable. I've tried reattaching th earpieces etc. and checking drivers but that doesn't appear to help. 

An interesting thing is that if I'm not the headset and am playing sound through the speakers it sounds fine, but when I put it on some contact must get disconnected or something because it just craps out again. I now play beat Saber with my wired gaming headset using a USB extension cord which, to say the least, isn't ideal.

The biggest ""downgrade"" is the far distance scenery surrounding you. It's essentially a medium quality ""image"" wrapped around the level. It's still pretty and relaxing to look at the surrounding distance however.

Also you can tell that the lighting is ""baked"" into the rocks/mountains you are climbing. Other than that it doesn't look any different to me that my brain can remember from playing it in 2016. 

The cooling fan they included on the Quest has done wonders to keep the processor cool - it really helps them push this hardware quite hard.

oculus,PSA: Why You probably SHOULDN'T buy a used CV1 off eBay,"So we all know about the CV1 cable kerfuffle, being on this subreddit it's impossible to miss because there are almost daily threads complaining about it. That isn't what this post is about, but for those who are living under a tin foil covered rock Oculus has stopped making the HDMI/USB cable that connects the headset to your PC, meaning you're stuck paying $120+ on eBay if yours happens to break.

Recently, I've noticed CV1s are going stupid cheap on eBay, like $150-200 cheap, and on the surface it seems like a great value. The CV1 has excellent tracking, great controllers, and at that price it seems like an absolute bargain, and if you're mindful about the cable you should be able to stretch it to a year or so and hopefully by that point there will be some kind of solution to the cable issue or other replacement VR hardware would be available or cheaper. No, the issue is with the actual headset condition itself.

The reason for the price drop is pretty simple: old Rift users are nervous about the state of the platform, and are trying to sell off their current hardware to help fund an upgrade to a Rift S or Index. This alone isn't an issue, thats just how markets work, but what *is* an issue is the large number of users misrepresenting their heavily used headset's condition trying to play off consumer ignorance. My friend just fell for one of these, and purchased a set that was described as in ""very good condition"" and that there was ""nothing wrong with it"". Then he got it and immediately asked if the headset [cable was supposed to look like this](https://i.imgur.com/W1eWGtU.jpg). Honest to god this thing has one of the worst cables I've seen, [and it's a small wonder it still works](https://i.imgur.com/s0omLs3.jpg). The shielding is crinkled and bent due to constant prolonged twisting, and is flat out broken in a couple of places where there are tight knots. I'm pretty sure if you remove the knot the cable will just fail. It's quite obvious that the seller knew this thing was nearing its end and passed it off while it still somewhat worked.

Just taking a quick look and there are more issues that can be pretty hard to spot in listings that I've rarely seen disclosed, such as scratched lenses, broken audio ribbon cables, cracked controllers (I've seen some clever camera angles), and missing sensor stands. I'm not saying all of them are bad, and I bet a lot are in great shape (some people on this sub have had good luck I know), but it's really hard to spot ones that are bad and there is a significant chance you get ""one of the bad ones"".

The thing with this is, eBay takes their post descriptions rather seriously (otherwise literally nobody would shop there), and is *incredibly* buyer-biased when dealing with issues like this. If eBay feels that the seller was being misleading in a small way, they usually side with the buyer (this is why you want to avoid sweeping claims like ""nothing wrong with it"" in your description when selling less than perfect items, as it pretty much always will bite you in the ass). Chances are he can get this sorted through eBay's support team, and if not he's just out the money he paid for the thing unless he wants to pay another $150 for the cable, as I doubt this thing will last more than a week of daily use.

So if you want to buy one just get one with the most detailed description, right? Well, that is a strategy, and will give you some help when going through ebay's buyer protection system, but honestly imo it's not worth it just so you don't have to go through the hassle of dealing with eBay scammers. If you are considering one, you can request more pictures of the lenses, accessories, and cable in the advert, which will help you not end up in this situation, although some photos (esp of lenses) won't be all that helpful.

If you're serious about wanting a Rift CV1 (I won't stop you, it's a great HMD), here are my tips. First, shop local on CL and FB Market. Then you can actually have a look and test what you're buying before dropping the money. If the seller is hesitant to let you do a test run with their computer equipment, then just walk. I seriously saw an ad from someone pretending that their computer didn't work with it and thats why they can't show you it works. Secondly, don't actually believe the sellers ""only used it for a week"" claims. Literally every single eBay and local ad I've seen always mentions how little they used it, and I wouldn't believe any of it. Finally, if you're still wanting to buy on eBay for the better buyer protection or due to a lack of local options, refer to the paragraph above and get as much info as possible before dropping the cash. You don't want to end up getting a damaged headset.

&amp;#x200B;

So yea, Tl;Dr there right now is a rush to get rid of CV1 hardware due to both its age and fear about the viability of it in the future, and this is leading to several worn out/partially damaged examples being sold as fully working units by people looking to get out. All it takes is to be an informed buyer, and remember to not settle for damaged hardware when you don't have to, but know you might have to if you are unlucky. Shopping local will probably be cheaper and give you a better result. 

Finally, if you are planning to sell your CV1, be as honest about it as possible and price it accordingly. I know it sucks that in a year your headset lost over 50% of its value, but misleading people like this hurts the growth of VR overall and especially on eBay there is a high chance it doesn't end well for you.

I noticed 2 weeks ago that I got the colored lines on it whenever I would put my headset on but it'd revert to normal within a few seconds. Just earlier I was trying to look for something, lifted my headset up a bit and the lines came back, but they stayed, I was wondering if it was the cable so I moved it around a bit but it stayed like that. Closing the game + steamvr didnt fix it, but restarting Oculus is what reverted it back to normal. Also the bottom of the view was like a pond of light the lines went into, idk. The white Light to indicate if there someone wearing the headset is also constantly on when this happens and wont go orange.

Im not sure if its noteworthy but the left side of my headset isnt really pulling the strap back in anymore, Idk if it was like that from the start.

Obviously this isnt something I really want happening to my headset just because i lift it up a bit to check for something irl.

This never happened to any of my other headsets.

I have to install oculus software before I can do anything with the damn thing, and it just. wont. install. Every time it ""finishes"" it says somthing went wrong and that I need to restart my PC. I've done that like, 3 times. But every time i try it again it gets stuck on ""working"". The only way for me to get it past that is to close the app and delete all temp folders for Oculus. Once I do that it installs again, But then after a bit i run into the same issue.

List of things I've tried/done:

Disabled antivirus/windows defender

made sure headset is plugged into a USB 3.0 port

Made sure my windows is updated

tried a different install location (it gives me an inegible drive error, and i wouldnt want to install it on an external drive anyways becasue it would probably slow down read/write times significantly, ruining the immersion.)

looking in regedit for improperly ordered permissions (the error for that didnt appear, but i have oculus all permissions just in case)

Contacted oculus support (waiting for a reply back)

Basically whenever you have a weapon in hand and hit an enemy with it, it never feels like the VR controllers are translating how much force you're putting in to your hit, it's always like you're gently slapping the enemy in game no matter how much force you're putting in to the controller irl. 

Anyone else annoyed by this? Anyone know a way this could be fixed? I'm guessing it would be fixed on the game Dev end rather than hardware specifically.

That all being said, in the last couple of days when I’ve been trying to sleep or just chilling out still, I’ve felt, well, a little motion... not ‘sick’... just, like I’m moving when I’m not, it’s hard to really convey, it’s not a nice feeling and I’d say it almost feels light headed... I don’t 100% know if it’s a side effect of VRing or not.

Anyway, I was just wondering if anyone else gets this and if so, does it go away, like, if I stick to playing will my brain / body get used to this and then chill out with the weird moving when not moving (and totally not in VR) feelings?

oculus,Oculus Rift S Controllers Cause Headset Blackout. Assistance Would Be Greatly Appreciated!,"Good afternoon Reddit, I'm coming to you today for an interesting technical problem occurring with hopes that someone here may have encountered the same, and even more hopeful that someone may have a fix. I have submitted a ticket and chatted with three different support specialists who were all very helpful, however all of them stated that they had never heard of this before. From reading the many troubleshooting posts throughout the web I was very well prepared to work with support and had tried everything that they asked me to prior to contacting them. Below are the troubleshooting methods I attempted:

* Disabled power saving mode shutting off USBs
* Ensured all USB ports did not shut down for power via the device manager
* Re-seated the headset cable ensuring all pins were in tact, as well as unplugging re-plugging Display and USB
* Updated all drivers (graphics, device
* Re download and reinstall, with firewalls and AV disabled
* Repair tool
* 100% clean windows installation, discarding all files
* Switch between all available display ports and USB ports
* Other things that I cant recall as I worked on the issue for approximately 10 hours last night.

Listed below are the specs of my hardware and applicable software:

* MSI Z170 gaming MOBO
* EVGA GTX 1080 FTW
* I7 6700k
* 32 GB RAM
* 120 GB SSD (OS), 240 GB SSD, 1TB SSD
* 650w PSU (not sure if that might be the issue as its fairly low)
* Windows 10 Build 19033.1 (unable to revert to earlier build, or do not have the know how)

To further explain the issue, essentially what is happening is the Oculus Rift S headset when put on will emit a low white light then flicker to black. I then have to take it off and place it back on to replicate the issue. Somehow after hours of testing I found that if I take the batteries out of the controllers the setup menu and the room around me (via onboard cameras) is visible. As soon as I put one battery into the controller the screen goes black. This disallows me from actually going through the setup tutorial. When scanning the event logs the only thing that I can find is this error; "" Oculusdash.exe"" error. I cannot seem to find any other posts or information about this issue and support specialists stated that they have never seen this before. Again, any help with this would be greatly appreciated as this is my first potential VR experience. I just received the box yesterday and I am excited to join you all in the Oculus world. Thanks,

I ended up getting an a USB C Display-port Adapter and giving it a try anyways because the USB C port shows the DP logo next to it. Plugged everything in and IT WORKS, although with a little stutter. If I minimize the screen mirroring on the desktop the stutter isn't as bad. 

What my question is, is the Rift S running off of my RTX 2060 on the system, or is the CPU discreet graphics somehow rendering things? Tested the Rift S with the Oculus VR mini game, Beat Saber, and Job Simulator and it was pretty much the same, some stutter around the edges of the screen but would improve if I minimized the screen mirroring on my desktop.",1575411831.0,5,7,196792

oculus,Rift S with External Sensors,"Listen, I know this post is going to face immediate criticism and I know I’m going to get people commenting saying “it’s never going to happen, just deal with it”, but just please let me dream... 

I posted something similar around June and wanted to bring it back up because nothing more has been said about it. Look, the Rift S sensors are pretty dang good, but not perfect. They really struggle for me in FPS games where I’m covering up one hand sometimes and in games like Arena and even BeatSaber My hand will spas out at the end of a swing (I think I’m swinging too hard lol). We talked about this issue early in the Rift S release but heard little back from Oculus when we asked “would it be possible to ever use Rift CV1 sensors in conjunction with the Rift S headset”. But we did get one answer. “It is possible”. An answer to give us hope and shut us up for awhile. 

Here we are months and months later watching the quest get upgrade after upgrade to its software capabilities and we are left with the same ol’ headsets we bought at launch. People have been quoted saying “I’d be much more comfortable upgrading to the Rift S if I could keep using my sensors”. Look, Oculus, people are not sold on your product because it’s getting no love. Give us something. At least give me another “it’s possible” to give me hope for a few more months. 

-Sincerely, A hopeless Rift S Owner

Edit: it was pointed out to me that there is a vote on oculus voice for adding external sensors. This is the platform that Oculus uses to make user requested decisions on what comes next in their development.

Unlike cheaper models of the same laptop, it does not have a Thunderbolt port, only a USB type c gen2 connected to the GPU (Display Port Ready)

A little more research, and I am being told it's because it's not a Thunderbolt port.

WUT? Why is this important? I'm baffled why a more expensive and higher spoecced laptop would have a USB type c Display Port connected to a GPU that is not Thunderbotl, thus rendering it completely incompatible with Rift S. Is this really the case?

I'm kind of devastated (This thing wasn't cheap and I do love it) and I know the Quest could work, but I am concerned with the heavier headset, the latency, and the lower refresh rate on the Quest using link.

And... the cherry - oculus had this issue long back when it was only starting where you could only install its client on your C drive. Just some silliness that was cleared back in... never. Yup, oculus now needs more than 10GB (about 21 including the installation files it also insists on downloading to the C drive) and still THEY DEMAND YOU INSTALL IT IN YOUR C DRIVE. Hey, oculus, ever hear about how people buy small SSD drives to install windows on? 

They make it appear on their support site there is a way around this, but, you guessed it, there isnt. Because although you can pass them a ""drive"" argument, it only applies to the games you will download later, which you can ALREADY CHANGE FROM THE FING SETTINGS MENU ANYWAYS.

I hope one guy in charge of the PC client team sees this, and that I wasted at least a fraction of the time of his, as he did to me. How can a company be so far on the edge of technology, and so far back at the same time.

3 hours in, and I'm still looking at the download page of the installer... 4/7.5GB.

oculus,Rift S doesn’t fit my face. Looking for suggestions.,"Hey y’all, thanks in advance for the help!

I got my Rift S yesterday, replacing my CV1. The CV1 used to fit my face perfect and was great, but the Rift S seems to drift, tilting down after minutes of play, skewing the image slightly. 

I’ve come to find out that it’s because I have weak ass cheekbones, and it doesn’t make contact with both above and below my eyes on my face, just above when in its optimal angle. This also introduces wobble to the entire display when moving. Tightening the straps / ratchet on the back only tighten the contact between my forehead and the back of my head, which only adds discomfort after a certain point and in no way solves my problem.

Has anyone else had this issue? I tested the headset on my roommates and they all say it’s way more comfortable than the CV1, but definitely not the case for me.",1575385364.0,6,9,196792

oculus,Is my CV1 cable broken?,"    Greetings! I just bought a slightly used (according to the seller) Oculus Rift + Touch with 3 sensors. Everything looked good until I plugged in the HDMI and USBs. The USBs and Touch controllers work great, but the HDMI won't detect for some reason. I've tried everything everyone has said to do on the forums. Ensuring the cable is fully plugged in, unplugging and replugging, updating my drivers, reinstalling the software. No luck. 

     I'll explain more in depth. If I plug in the HDMI first, nothing happens; no lights, no nothing. If I plug in the connected USB first, I get one green check and a red light turns on in my headset. Then when I plug in the HDMI, the red light changes to either white or blue (I'm a bit colorblind), images go through my headset, and I can hear sound out of both headphones. For some reason I see the skyrim main screen. However, the HDMI still isn't recognized. I continue to setup my sensors but it doesn't change anything, the Oculus still says the HDMI is undetected.

The Oculus Code of Conduct says, ""*Do not: Use or promote sexually explicit content or conduct yourself in a sexually obscene or abusive way.*"" *""For repeated or egregious offenses, we may permanently disable your account.""*

Among consenting adults, sexual media, communication, and behavior is normal and healthy and is not equatable with abuse. Sexual expression is among the first uses of any communication technology from cave paintings to video chat. (*Rule 34 of the internet: If it exists, or can be imagined, there is internet porn of it.*) Furthermore, VR/AR promises to be a general purpose computing and collaboration technology. I can understand the desire to create safe spaces for certain audiences, and the desire to prevent abuse of all kinds, but the platform-wide banning of sex seems like a Black Mirror plot twist leading to a dystopic future.

It creates a ""suspected terrorist"" or ""drug war"" situation in which the vast majority of users knowingly break the code of conduct (which can be interpreted as a legal contract for many purposes) and are subject to de-platforming and exclusion for unstated reasons and zero legal recourse. Where purchased hardware can become ""bricked"" at the whim of the manufacturer. Censoring adult app developers from the Oculus Store prevents them from economically participating with a large audience of willing customers, and disincentivizes creative investment in the genre.

This topic also ties into the broader topic of private companies controlling public discourse without the public having recourse to amend these often secret and politically/socially motivated policies. Not to mention the idea that in the near future (or present?) black box AI algorithms may be controlling public discourse for motivations of their own without human oversight thus allowing our culture to be molded by powerful influence technologies with no broader understanding or appreciation of consequences.",1575416629.0,0,17,196792

A friend did a solution with a small wireless keyboard he had in his pocket to have access to text commands and special key binds. That works fine he says but me liking to take the harder and more complicated way thought I could have a USB Hub between the headset and battery.

I'm not very experienced when it comes to hardware so I'm asking here first: Would it be possible to run the OpenTPCast OS on a different system besides the TPCast module?
For example; Raspberry Pi is a Linux single board PC with integrated wireless card, four USBs and one HDMI port. I'm pretty sure the native TPCast module is stronger compared to the Pi, but a different mother board such as the Mini-ITX with additional cards and ports on it can be used too. I haven't tried it yet as I don't have a spare Micro-USB right now to use in my Raspberry Pi 3, but if you guys think it's, possible next time I walk into my town's computer store I might buy one with the intent of flashing OpenTPCast to it.",1575381506.0,2,0,196792

oculus,Rift S is a definite upgrade over the CV1,"With the current holiday VR deals, I decided to rid myself of the Oculus sensors once and for all. I brought home a shiny new Rift S. Most reviews mentioned this as being the primary reason to ""upgrade"", but were hesitant to really call the Rift S a proper successor. Well, after 4 hours with the headset, I'd say this is very clearly better than my CV1. It's like experiencing VR again for the first time.

**Note:** The Rift S has very distinct physical limitations not found in the CV1/Quest related to the lack of physical IPD adjustments. The Rift S presents no upgrade worth suffering if you are outside of the supported range.

**Specs Don't Lie, They Just Don't Tell the Whole Truth**

The Rift S has deceptively bad specs. Slightly higher resolution but a drop in refresh rate and panel quality. You'd be forgiven if you mistook the Rift S as a new budget model. Yes, it has inside-out tracking, and yes it has a more comfortable mount, but both of those things can be solved by us, the consumer, with a little more money and elbow grease. Yet, there exists another thing that we cannot fix that desperately needs to be: The Lenses

**The Spotlight is Gone**

The biggest problem with the CV1 has got to be the Godrays. They destroy clarity, image quality, and immersion. Like a bright shining beacon hiding behind every object that comes your way, the godrays created by the CV1 lenses cheapened the entire experience. On the Rift S they are greatly reduced to the point of being a graphical feature rather than distortion.

If I had to rate the intensity of the Godrays from 1-10, the CV1 would be a 7 and the Rift S a 3. I'm sure it can get even better, but I feel like we're at the threshold where it's ""good enough"".

**Is it Hot in Here?**

Speaking of image clarity, no one mentions the CV1 being prone to getting fogged up. I guess because it's just a problem in the first 10 minutes of play, but I can't tell you how many times I've had to readjust my headset to stop my breath from fogging up the lenses. Even the moisture from your eyes is enough to get it misty. Has not happened with the Rift S yet. I put it on and it's good right from the start.

**Replacing the Screen Door**

While OLED is superior in black level and color vividness, LCD has the benefit of being brighter with better pixel arrangement. That means that you're seeing less dot pitch and more of a seamless image. In the CV1 I was able to see the space between pixels very easily, but the Rift S does a much better job of hiding this. There are times when the SDE just.. disappears.

**Playing More Makes Sense**

There is nothing inherently wrong with the sensor system on the CV1. What inside-out tracking provides is ease of scalability. Everyone knows that if you're playing in multiple rooms or using a VR capable laptop the Rift S is a huge benefit, but not many people mention how awesome it is for going from room-scale to sitting at a desk. Or laying in bed. Or just facing an entirely different direction from where your computer is.

I don't have a dedicated space to play VR so this appeals to me on an entirely different level than someone who does. I need to make the best out of my available space as soon as it comes up. That might mean playing Vader Immortal in my desk chair or beat saber in the space by the door. I couldn't before. Now I can.

**Being Alone With Your Thoughts is Scary**

Some people love being fully immersed and closed off from the real world when they play in VR. That's scary to me. I'm always conscious of someone walking up to me or needing my attention. I know the Guardian system is there, but since I do move around I end up turning that off. For that reason I usually don't fully place the headphones or often peek through the little space above my nose. The Rift S solves this problem completely by allowing me to see through the cameras.

I can align with reality while being in virtual reality.

**Not Quite Refreshed**

So why bother with the CV1 if you can get the Rift S? 90hz screens. I'll always reiterate that playing VR is better than no VR, and if 90hz makes you feel a bit queazy, 80hz can likely make you feel super queazy. There is a difference, and I would be weary of getting feedback from anyone that says otherwise.

I've adapted to playing VR so I don't feel motion sick, but I can appreciate the difference in refresh rate. It's not a deal breaker for me by any means, but it's there. One of those aspects that you can clearly see the next version improving.

**The Quest for the Right Headset**

So I fully believe the Rift S is a full and complete upgrade from the CV1, but does that mean it's the only upgrade? Not by a long shot. I plan on trying out a Quest in the near future and seeing if the Rift S holds up. Just like there are things that the Rift S provides above and beyond a spec sheet, the Quest provides a feature you can't find elsewhere for the same cost: Untethered gameplay. Lots of us would give up a bit of graphical clarity for an entirely new experience all together. The question is whether I would, and I'm dying to find out.

I hope I was able to help any of you who were on the fence just like me. It sucks to know that we spent over $700 for the CV1 experience only for it to be replaced by a $350 bundle, but I think the Rift S is worth the money. There's a big hurdle with improving resolution in future headsets and it's not just the headset itself but also the computer. Ask yourself if you plan on spending another $600-800 in the near future for a graphics card upgrade. If the answer is no, then Rift S or Quest Link might be the best you can handle. If the answer is yes, then you need to ask yourself how long you are willing to wait before the next headset.",1575333535.0,24,32,196792

oculus,1 Day in VR: My Experience,"I purchased a rift S after years of wanting to be apart of the VR world, and it is incredible. So far I’d say I’ve spend about 4ish hours between a few games...mainly super hot and Arizona sunshine. 

Outside a few crashes, everything has worked fairly easily. I haven’t quite figured out navigating VR outside of games. Oculus and steam each have their own “home,” and neither seem to have all my games in one place. To view my VIVEPORT games I have to open vive up and it essentially shows just like my desktop. That has been less than ideal, but honestly I think is more due to me not knowing how to use the software then the software itself. Any guidance would be helpful! 

The Rift S itself has been amazing. Extremely easy setup, great display, comfortable fit. The sound, of course, is just okay and can be improved with earbuds or a headset. So far I’ve honestly been okay with the built in headphones, but everything just sounds okay. The tracking of my body and head movement as well as hands is very good. I have a fairly small play area to work with, it meets the minimum recommendation, but still nothing impressive. I’ve hit the wall a couple times( sorry neighbor,) but generally the guardian does a good job at telling me where I am. I turned it up a bit to given me more of a warning with my small area. 

Motion sickness has been iffy. Any game where I start to feel sick I have put off for now. After playing superhot or Arizona sunshine for an hour or so I will feel the need to take off my headset. It’s a very slight uncomfort, and something that I think time will fix. Games with sliding are rough right now, and have avoided as such. Teleporting isn’t ideal for me gameplay wise, but it does a MUCH better job at keeping your head ok. 

Overall, very impressed with the technology and can’t wait to experience more. I know I have just touched the tip of the iceberg. 

This has been a quick and not planned out description of what my experience has been so far, but I hope it helps someone looking into VR. Ask me questions or give me suggestions if you have any!",1575325597.0,26,41,196792

OUR GAME IS a first-person VR shooting game with fast pace and uses human body’s instinct reaction to play. The stimulation of bullets flying over your ear will make you totally immerse into it and can’t help squatting down, turning to one side or looking for shelter to escape the bullets. At the same time ,you have to pay attention to your back, because the enemies never only attack you from the front, please apply your excellent shooting shills to deal with the enemies again and again.",1575390811.0,0,2,196792

oculus,"I was wrong, SO very wrong!, I'm sorry!","So years ago way back in 2015 is when I first experienced VR, It was in the form of google cardboard on my Galaxy S5. The lack of real fun games on cardboard left me with a bad taste in my mouth and I assumed that this would be the same crappy experience on a real VR headset. I can't believe how damn naive I was to believe that a real HMD like the oculus would be disappointing like cardboard, But damn I gotta say I was dead wrong, so wrong in fact that I'm mentally beating myself up about it. I should have bought a Rift years ago and can't believe I'm just now joining real VR gaming for the first time. I feel like a jackass tbh. I had a powerful PC too since 2013. I finally got to jump into some real VR games today now that my family went back home after staying over the weekend for thanksgiving. So I had a lot of time for myself finally. Today I played Robo Recall and that alone made me pause and just be in sheer awe at the experience I was having, It was like feeling like a kid again at the arcades, And not only was I having a blast but I was getting exercise too! After playing some beat saber today I was exhausted! But thats a good thing, I am 280 and overweight, This VR thing can definitely help me get more active and lose weight, Thats a WIN WIN in my book. 

So I just wanna say sorry, I made several comments over the years on Reddit, Facebook ect saying that VR sucks and that its never going to go mainsteam because its too expensive ect..  I am here to stay and I cant believe it but I'm already looking to upgrade from the CV1, Which BTW I bought as a way to introduce myself into VR to see if I like it before I go full swing and buy a more expensive Rift S or maybe the Vive index.

oculus,"Oculus support of next gen XBOX, reasoning","[I know Phil Spencer has come out stating that he just doesn't see enough traction in VR yet](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2019-11-28-phil-spencer-nobodys-asking-for-vr-on-xbox) to support it on the next xbox console, certainly not on the same level as Playstation with their own titles and headset(s).

What I wonder is why wouldn't Oculus consider working with Microsoft to bring Rift S or Quest Link support to the new XBOX?  There seem to be a ton of positives for both companies, a lot of hard work is already done.

\+ XBox Scarlett (next gen Xbox) is a closed system with fixed specs, it would be MUCH easier to support both hardware and software wise when developing both drivers (for the headset) and software (games/experiences) when you know EXACTLY what your hardware performance budget would be on a fixed platform

\+ Scarlett will very likely already have the necessary physical connections (HDMI, USB3)

\+ Scarlett is a much easier point of entry for your average consumer (go to the store, buy console, buy headset), no longer worrying about CPU/GPU/USB bandwith, different hardward configurations, bad drivers, users trying to buy a shitty pre-built PC with underpowered components having a horrible first experience since set-up and configuration of a console is MUCH easier

\+ Much larger target audience for Oculus to sell software and hardware to, yes yes I know PC gaming is huge and global but again not anywhere as easy to get into as going to your local electronics shop and picking up a console

\+ Driver functionality is already on Windows platforms, would require porting but it's not from some exotic not well understood platform, yes XBOX has it's own set of architecture but with Microsoft pushing development to their platforms to be similar (write once port few) I don't imagine it would be hugely destabilizing to their already existing software

\+ No longer hands the future of VR on consoles to Sony, more reasons for developers to no longer think of Sony as the only place they can sell their software in that space

\+ Key differentiator for Microsoft, showing that they're open to working with products you already own, you can play games on a console OR PC with the same headset

I'm sure there would be a fair bit of work for both companies, MS would have to support Oculus from an OS level since all the tracking stuff would have to be done in the background (probably difficult to run both tracking software and games at the same time without OS level support for this.  Oculus would have to port a lot of their existing software and it's not clear how buying software would work since both companies have their own stores.  

Still to me the positives seem pretty significant for this sort of partership.",1575395027.0,0,7,196792

I would press the button and the software would either stay on the screen it was at or it would restart and it would say the same thing. I would also put on the headset to see if it would turn on even with it saying this, and I would either see a black screen or a screen with three white dots.

I eventually deleted all Oculus files from my computer and reinstalled the software. The setup was smoother than before so I thought it had fixed. 

Either later that night or the next day, I went to play it again and it shut off mid-game twice. Ever since then it has been occasionally working for no real reason.

Pre ordered touch and when it arrived (I bought 2 sets to get a 3rd sensor) thought that I had a problem with my 2500K mobo usb. I bought an Inateck 4 port USB 3 and seemingly ever few minutes of robo recall I maybe got 5 frustrating hours total out of it. I just decided my computer was to blame.

First up I'm a software developer, although not a game developer.   
My kid is going nuts for an Oculus VR headset, he's been saving for a long time trying to get the cash together (he's 11, so it's gonna take a while).    
I was planning to split the difference with him and get a second hand set for 
 him for christmas, but things are tight right now so it's not possible.   
I did find a couple of Oculus dev kit 1's online for really cheap (less than €100), would my son be able to use  one of those for normal VR gaming?   
Is it worth trying, or should we just wait it out until I can get the money together?

oculus,"Massive Technical Issues, any help is appreciated","I just got a Rift S last night, and since I got home I've had nothing but issues. I installed the app (using the beta), and plugged the headset in, however, I can't pair the touch controllers to the headset itself. When I try to pair the controllers, the light on the headset turns orange from white, then goes off, then goes back to orange, meanwhile in the app nothing happens for a varying amount of time until I get an error saying that there's a hardware issue preventing pairing.   


In addition to that,  the headset itself has been randomly disconnecting from my computer (hardware notification displayport disconnect), then reconnecting, then disconnecting again.  


I've plugged an xbox controller in, loaded steam VR, and I was able to use it for roughly five minutes before I got an error message saying that the display adapter has disconnected. It'll then reconnect a few seconds later. That's the only time I've managed to get it even close to working. Any other time I try to start steam VR, the display port disconnects. This has happened every time I've tried to start steam.  


So far, I've updated the following driversr (USB, graphics card, oculus driver etc), altered permissions to allow all camera/microphone permissions, turned off disconnect to save power functionality, plugged the rift into almost every usb port on my computer (always plugging the usb in before the display adapter).  


Meanwhile, since I started this process, my other usb devices have started intermittently disconnecting

My specs on my computer are as follows  


Amd Radeon 290 graphics card (minimum card, but at this point i'm just trying to get this working)  
8gb ram  
AMD Ryzen 2700x processor  
600 watts PSU

oculus,VR not turning on,"Heya, so I just recently got the Oculus Rift S, and occasionally it won't turn on. Like, at all. I try unplugging and unplugging both the USB and the Display port, I try to restart the oculus software in the beta settings on the app, I even try unplugging and unplugging the cord inside the headset. The only thing that seems to work is restarting my computer, which starts to get very aggravating since I have to wait for it to boot up, log into the computer, open viveport, open steam and log in, when all I'm wanting to do is play some beat saber. Does anyone happen to have a solution to this problem? Also, when I say it won't turn on, I mean when I plug in the USB the orange/white light won't turn on no matter what I do.",1575325683.0,4,7,196792

oculus,Upcoming VR headsets. When?,"I pre-ordered the CV1 back when it was announced and sold it about a year ago. I sold it because, although I am a massive fan of VR and still super excited about it, I felt like I had seen everything gen 1 had to offer and the CV1 screen just wasn't cutting it anymore.

I still really want another VR headset, but I've decided that the Valve Index is the minimum I am willing to put up with in terms of overall experience, and I am not willing to pay that kind of price. So I'm waiting for either a price cut or a new headset.

As far as I can tell, no new VR headsets have been announced for 2020. Surely we will get something new from either the usual suspects or Hp, or Samsung? or have HP and Samsung given up on VR altogether? 2019 was a good year for VR in terms of numbers, and the market is expected to expand significantly over the coming years, so it's surprising no new headsets are even being hinted at.

I am also really surprised Oculus aren't releasing a high end VR headset for enthusiasts. I don't see why it couldn't co-exist with their current heasets.

Other than that, any idea when we will start seeing discounts on the Index? I can't remember how long it took for them to discount the vive.",1575325400.0,6,14,196792

oculus,Quest vs Rift S purchase and IPD problem,"Greetings!

I'm looking at purchasing either the Quest or Rift S at the moment. Those are the only options I have, can't get any of the other headsets on my country. I also cannot buy something and then return it later, so my purchase would be pretty much final.

I want to, mostly, play PCVR games. The issue is, I have a far IPD of 70.7.

I tested the Rift S for like half an hour and it wasn't catastrophically blurry, but there's the sense that something was not right and the image was not perfectly clear. Also somehow the FOV was really low. In my experience it was even lower than the PSVR fov, and the PSVR isn't great at all in any regard. Didn't try adjusting the eye relief slider before putting the headset on my face (only adjusted it after wearing the headset), but I don't know if that would make any difference on the FOV.

So then I was also looking at the Quest, since it has a mechanical IPD adjustment. However, it seems that a lot of people are having issues with Link (yeah it's a beta, but no guarantees that the experience will rival a native PCVR solution), and it's honestly a concerning. Between the lower refresh rate, video compression stuff and other issues that I saw people having such as image freezes and random crashes/disconnects, it makes me think that purchasing this one would be a bit of a leap of faith that eventually it will be pretty much as good as other PCVR headsets.

If the rift S had an ipd slider this would be an easy choice. Thanks facebook!

It will says in the Devices menu ""Oculus software requires restart"". Saturday and Sunday were both fixed in different ways. Today I can't get it working as the setups just throw the ""Sensors can't track headset"" error during sensor check.

Maybe I've missed something while searching for fixes, but I'll list everything I've tried below. It's clearly a software problem as I doubt I would get the same error 3 times, with it being software the first 2 and suddenly hardware on the 3rd.

Saturday
- Restarted software multiple times
- Restarted PC
- Disconnected and reconnected headset
- All of the above in multiple different orders
- Turned off and on camera access in Windows 10 privacy settings - WORKED

Sunday
- All of the above
- Reinstalled Oculus software (took 2 hours)
- Removed Rift S from devices in Oculus software and performed Rift S first time setup again - WORKED

Monday
- All of the above (minus 2 hour reinstall)
- First time setup results in either perpetual sensor check or ""Sensors can't track headset"" error

oculus,Modifying Rift S touch controllers to have a better grip button - Questions,"Hello everyone. I was considering 3d printing a sort of plate or new button to replace the current grip button to be bigger and offer more natural grip of in game items.

Keep in mind, this is assuming you have some sort of way to strap the controller to your hand, something generally like the index has.

My questions are:

Are the grip buttons capacitive? I havent encountered a game that uses it (or can't recall at this moment), if it is. This would most likely make this project dead in the water.

Would the community find this useable or interesting? Consider that this most likely would void any sort of warranty if the final solution requires taking the controller apart.

oculus,Yet another Rift S vs Quest report,"I'll try to keep it short.

I own CV1 and OGO and ordered Rift S to potentially replace CV1 and Quest to potentially replace CV1 and OGO.

Here are my findings.

**Rift S**

\-Clarity: ridiculously good, much better than expected. Why were so many people claiming that it's only a small improvment to CV1? For me it's a massive step. I can not just read things more easily than I could before, I can easily read things that I wouldn't have thought were even possible to read in VR.

&amp;#x200B;

\-No more god rays, yay!

&amp;#x200B;

\-Sweetspot? The whole lens is a massive sweetspot. I can look with my eyes in all directions and I don't need to waste any time with adjusting the postition of my headset all the time. This probably also why they can get away with no IPD adjustment.

&amp;#x200B;

\-The cable is longer, yay, I can turn my PC back to facing the right way...

&amp;#x200B;

\-Audio: they've got to be kidding me. I was expecting bad, but this is a joke.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Tracking: didn't notice anything out of the ordinary.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Comfort: I was scared at first, since design reminded me of the terrible Odyssee+ but I have to say: it's even better than CV1.

&amp;#x200B;

\-FOV: this feels really tight, maybe it's the price you pay for the huge sweet spot.

&amp;#x200B;

\-What's that button on the bottom? A mechanism to adjust the distance of the lenses to the face? Wow. Why wasn't anyone talking about this? Will make it much easier to maximise FOV and allow glasses wearers to try the headset.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Passthrough: OMG. Game changer. Put on the headset, don't take it off to have a drink, speak to the wife, get my chair, find my keyboard etc. You can even use it as an AR device where you walk around the room, from one huge screen to the next.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Negatives: Audio, Audio, Audio, and the cable is much more ""sticky"" compared to CV1. Will try to fix it using a mesh sleeve.

&amp;#x200B;

**Quest (Link)**

\-People wern't kidding, it's uncomfortable immediately. Nowhere near Odyssee+ levels of uncomfortableness, so not a complete show stopper, but investing time and money to fix it isn't very appealing to me.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Hello god rays, hello SDE, I missed you.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Visuals: better than CV1, but not close to Rift S.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Audio: same as Rift S.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Supports passthrough but not by double-tapping a button. Wtf?

&amp;#x200B;

\-Volume buttons! Why couldn't they add this to Rift S?

&amp;#x200B;

\-Performance: terrible, smooth 80/90 in Skyrim on Rift (S), 36fps on Quest? What gives? Investigated and it turns out that Quest link has a much higher render target resolution than Rift and Rift S. After reducing it using Debug tools performance was fine, but the fact remains that ASW at 36fps isn't the same thing as ASW at 40 or 45 fps.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Can I sell my OGO? Nope. Many apps aren't available at all, like the Felix and Paul documentaries or Pigasus player. There is no way to switch user accounts other than factory reset (I have two accounts, one for Rift, one for OGO). Sideloading OGO apks to Quest will mostly result in ""entitlement error"", regardless of whether it's a free or paid app, or if it's an app I bought on the active account.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Untethered Quest native apps: for me 72 fps is not really enough buttery smoothness and playing untethered in the same space in which I could just use a cable doean't really seem like a game changer. A game changer would have been if the Quest library had taken off as a VR console with AAA exclusive games like on Switch. But it didn't turn out that way, Quest library are just low-spec and expensive versions of PCVR games. While in the mean time PCVR gets HLA, Asgard's, Stormlands and Boneworks.

&amp;#x200B;

**The verdict**

oculus,"Should I gift my father the Oculus Go, or Quest?","So I had my father over a few days ago and showed him Google Earth in VR on my Rift S, and it completely blew him away. He isn't much of a gamer, though he used to be and I could see him going that direction if given a low maintenance option (Rift S and gaming computer certainly is not in the cards). He told me he was thinking about getting something for VR in the near future so I figured this might be the perfect gift for him if I can narrow it down to the right device. I understand that there is a 200 dollar difference and that with the quest you're getting two controllers versus one, and access to more games. How substantial is the spec difference between these two? Is one more user friendly than the other? My gut tells me he is more than likely going to stick to non gaming experiences with the VR, but I'm hoping you all might be able to provide more insight on what he's really going to get out of the Go or Quest.

The other day (4 days ago) I got my Rift S, and to be completely honest setting it up and getting it to work has been a nightmare that hasn't yet ended.

Don't get me wrong, the headset is great &amp; I'd love to keep it but at this point I either need someone to help me out NOW or the headset is being returned to retail.

Basically, problem 1:  
The right hand controller is only half functioning, half of the ring is out and the other half has IR lights that are extremely dim.

Problem 2:  
When the rift is plugged in &amp; running on my head my internet just conks out, kaput, gone. No idea why, I've attempted to change channels &amp; try running only on 5.0ghz but this has not changed anything at all. (I've tried resetting my internet multiple times too &amp; am unable to use an Ethernet cable)

Problem 3:  
The headset has to be uplugged &amp; replugged in almost every time I first start my PC, and even then sometimes it wont start correctly, forcing me to unplug the cable from the HMD, which 100% of the time fixes the issue.

Have I tried troubleshooting all of these? Yes. I've restarted my computer multiple times, I've messed around with my PC settings (USB power saving etc), I've re-installed the software 3 times now &amp; have tried repairing the install a couple times too &amp; many more methods.

I've tried holding on to it but really at this point I think it's a lost cause, I've been in contact with Oculus but having to wait 2 days for every response is not worth it. It's basically just been 4 days of trying to get the thing to work properly and I don't think the issues are justifying the high price spend.

I don't know if I'm just unlucky or doing something wrong.

Another question that might be harder to answer is- If Link will not support my graphics card, do you think I should just get the Rift S, or should I upgrade my graphics card and then get the Quest? The only problem with this is that it would take me significantly more time to save up for both of these things, and one of the main reasons I want to get a VR headset is to play Steam games (like Elite Dangerous and Boneworks). So in this scenario, would I just be better off with a Rift S? I have heard some people say that the Rift S might become obsolete, and with Link it makes the Quest better in almost every way, but for someone in my position, do you think I should care to this extent? 

Sorry to make this post so long, but with so much money I want to make sure I have considered all my options.

Unfortunately I've been unable to get to square one due to the way the Oculus drivers install. I run a firewall called TinyWall on my home PC, which stops various apps phoning home. Letting any app through the firewall is pretty trivial (usually) as you can allow connection by executable, process or even window. Unfortunately none of these methods seem to work with the Oculus installer, as it spawns some kind of additional executable at run time (in Users\UserName\AppData\Local\Temp and the provides a 'Can't connect' message before the process can be allowed to continue. I've scoured the net and found a few different solutions - e.g.: downloading files on another computer then running locally. Unfortunately they don't work. There doesn't seem to be any kind of offline installer available either.

I'm aware that right now there is no ""AAA"" VR game (at least until HL: Alyx), but through ports like Skyrim VR, Fallout VR and unofficial ports like Doom 3 BFG, you can experience really long games in a completely new light.

Ports like these fascinate me, and since I'm a long time fan of the Elder Scrolls series, I wondered if there was a Morrowind port. I found that there was one made a long time ago, called Morrowrift, but that unfortunately didn't have motion controller support and was eventually abandoned.

I'm of the philosophy that if something you want doesn't exist, you should make it, so I set my sights on making a new Morrowind VR port with the new OpenMW engine, since I could have access to its source code. But even though I have some game development knowledge, I don't even know where to start porting this game, so here I am, asking for assistance, or any pointers at all, really.

I know this probably would not work to well and would not be to precise, but my long term idea is to put magnets in haptic gloves to help simulate resistance and pull.

oculus,Some Love for Westworld Awakening,"Westworld Awakening has been sitting in my Oculus library since launch day and I finally got into it, and boy am I glad I did. I’m not seeing too much love for the game on this subreddit, so I thought I’d share mine.

This is perhaps one of the best VR narratives that I’ve had the pleasure of experiencing, and that’s what this is: an experience mixed with gamey puzzle elements. The polish on this title has blown me away. It’s environments are visually stunning and although the game doesn’t have you shooting and blasting your way out of DELOS, it does have you ducking for cover, sneaking past enemies, and scanning items in the world, all in an effort to further the narrative it’s trying to create--and with great success.

You play as a female Host named Kate, who is programed to experience a living hell day in and day out. Like I said before, you’re not the one doing the hunting and shooting in this story. There are people coming after you, and this game does its darndest to make you feel that way. I felt the sheer terror and vulnerability of being a host, destined to die. It’s astonishing and frightening, much more than I initially anticipated, though it should be noted that it’s not always this way. Westworld Awakening expertly balances horror, adventure, and mystery throughout it’s 4 chapters.

One of the things this game does best is immerse you through its dialogue and characters. Though there aren’t too many to keep track of, those you encounter will be memorable, as you find that most things aren’t what they appear to be. You spend a lot of time listening to a dude through an earpiece, but the dialogue between your character and the guy is so good, you can’t help but feel like you’ve gotten to know the two.

After each chapter, the game will ask if you want to continue, and I always found myself doing so. Similar to the TV show, each chapter leaves the player on some sort of cliffhanger that has you begging to find out what happens next, and that’s just evidence of compelling story-telling. While the story itself isn’t complicated, the way the game puts you in the center of the action makes it that much more engaging. The ending was pretty good. I think it could have been wrapped up with a better final scene, but I was ultimately left satisfied. I think you’ll definitely find it more appealing if you’re a fan of the series, but even if you know nothing about the show, the game gives you enough context throughout your adventure so that you’re not left feeling like some sort of interloper of the fandom.

The only bug I ran into was once when I had to scan objects on walls, but because I already moved made my way into different rooms while the dialogue was still going, I wasn’t able to continue because I assumed progressed too fast and the game got confused. On the flip side, the game does quick-save constantly, so you’re able to reload checkpoints and they’ll spawn you not too far from where you left off.

In terms of locomotion options, both are smooth, and there is no option for teleportation. By default the game is set to arm swing locomotion, where you'll move forward and in the direction your headset is facing when you swing your arms back and forth as if you're walking. Personally, I'm not a fan, so I switched to smooth locomotion via joystick. I don't think the game came with this option when it first released, so kudos to the devs for the update! Also, there's both snap and smooth turning.

Game-length wise, the game spans 4 chapters, with each chapter taking me roughly an hour to complete. I don’t feel as if I rushed through it, but I saw what I wanted to see and read what I wanted to read. Depending on if reading logs on a tablet is your kind of thing, this game may take slightly longer or shorter.

The title is currently on sale on both Steam and the Oculus Store for $29.99, and I wholeheartedly recommend it!

\- [AMVR did one for the Rift S](https://www.amazon.com/AMVR-Interface-Bracket-Leather-Replacement/dp/B07Z3DW7T5?language=en_US) but it's out of stock everywhere (in France, even in the US), a ""knock-off"" brand did this [but it's probably cheap](https://www.amazon.fr/Eyglo-Couverture-Protecteur-Respirant-Remplacement/dp/B07YTSFC3P/ref=sr_1_7?__mk_fr_FR=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&amp;keywords=Rift+S&amp;qid=1575841996&amp;sr=8-7), and with the AMVR facial interface, the ""plastic interface"" and foam is given, but sadly if you buy the knock-off, you'll have to remove the Stock foam from your Rift S.

\- I tried [this cotton cover and it's really bad](https://www.amazon.fr/Akakawa-Oculus-Rift-Cover-Pack/dp/B07TW6G19Z/ref=sr_1_1?__mk_fr_FR=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&amp;keywords=Rift+S+cover&amp;qid=1575843077&amp;sr=8-1).

It has been as cheaper on clearance, but this is still a solid deal at almost half off.  It comes in three colors so you can do patterns if you like.  It's also moisture-resistant and super easy to cut and work with so if you want to do a whole room you can cut it down to fit flush.

Probably not the best if you have carpet in your VR area, but I really like these types of mats underneath a round rug.  Gives a little more cushion jumping around or if you are playing a game that you get low in (hands knees or crawling).

I have the Rift S since last weekend and so far am loving it. However, today I noticed smudges on the lenses, a bigger one on the left lense and a smaller one on the right lense, that I don't seem to be able to clear using a microfiber cloth: [https://imgur.com/a/HEUbTec](https://imgur.com/a/HEUbTec)

I'm wearing glasses and so far have been using the Rift S ""by the book"", only using a clean microfiber cloth provided by my optician, using the button on the headset to provide more space for the glasses and putting the heaset on like described on the oculus website. So I find it a bit annoying, mildly speaking, that the lenses are so sensitive they already caught scratches after one week/maybe 4 longer sessions, even paying attention to all the caveats.

Since I received the headset only one week ago I could potentially return it, but I got it through a special Black Friday deal, and if I were to buy a new one I'd pay 100€ more than I originally paid.

So what would you do in my case? The scratches are not that big, noticeable in VR when paying attention to it, but bearable. My idea would be to get prescription lenses from VR optician or Widmo VR (which one is better, is there any difference?) and if the scratches keep getting worse or start to annoy me more, use something like polywatch.

oculus,OG Touch Controllers have broken vibrations,"Hey, so I'm running the OG Rift on my PC (3600 and 5700xt) and the vibrations are messed up. Everything was working fine until Oculus auto-updated drivers. My PC would randomly BSOD during gameplay. I gave it like a week and updated drivers again. No more BSOD and I could play VR again. In Robo Recall, something didn't feel right, but I kept playing. It wasn't until I played Beat Saber when I really noticed the problem:

Touching the Sabers together usually gives a really nice vibration that's rather convincing. Instead, it buzzed for a fraction of a second and stopped. The same went for every time I hit a note.

I thought something was wrong with the motors and that they were breaking. I don't have the money to replace the controllers, so I decided to just deal with it. Then the weirder thing happened.

I have no Idea why, but in Superhot, the controllers vibrate for way too long than too short. Every time I pick up a weapon, it buzzes for 3 seconds. Fire: constant vibration. Finish the level and grab the pyramid? full 10ish seconds of vibration.

At this point I'm thoroughly confused. I'm pretty sure it's not the hardware cause it's different in every game I play.

It shipped last week and my package was supposed to arrive on Thursday. On Thursday, will keeping track of my package, UPS say they are returning the package to sender. I call UPS and they inform me that the sender forgot to put the commercial invoice on the box, so they can’t ship it to Canada and that I should contact the sender (Oculus).

I then proceed to open a ticket explaining the situation, waiting a day without answer. After a live chat with an agent, they inform me that I would need to wait for them to receive the returned package and then wait 4 business days for them to investigate. I inform them that it seems like a pretty long delay and that in about 2 weeks I will be away on vacation without internet access, which is a bit troublesome given the situation. I said it would be much faster to simply send a new unit, as the error is on their part and the package never even left the US.

A day later, someone else replies to my ticket informing me that I will be receiving a reimbursement in 5-7 business days and that I would be able to re-order another Rift S by then, ensuring that I update my shipping info (implying there was an error with my shipping info when there wasn’t at all, I checked).

I responded that I did not want to order a new Rift S at full price when I bought mine at the BF reduced price. I contacted the live chat and the agent told me that he forwarded that to a new team which will respond to it in 4 business days.

Is this really supposed to be this way? I feel like this is getting ridiculous as I made no error placing my order and now I’m stuck on knowing nothing about what or when anything is going to happen.

Ironically, possibly the only situation where having only USB 3.0 for your I/O is a downside. That's right. Not a single lick of USB 2.0. Rear I/O, 3 separate dual USB 3.0 ports side-to-side. A thunderbolt port. And just the standard video/audio ports. Two USB 3.0s on the front too, dang.

Oculus recommends putting any 3rd or 4th sensor on USB 2.0. Many say this is helps prevent any tracking issues. I reckon it's because having 3+ sensors gobbling USB 3.0 bandwidth is a sure way to slow things down. 

Thankfully, I have USB 2.0 extension cables laying around.

I've had my ASUS WMR for the last year and it's worked well - I enjoy it a lot although I do have some gripes with it.

oculus,Why does nobody talk about the small Rift S FOV?,"So, first of sorry if my english is not perfect, it's not my first language.

&amp;#x200B;

I currently have 3 VR headsets at home: Oculus Rift S, Quest and now even an Index.

The FOV of the Rift S is so bad I just can't play with it anymore and am now in the process of selling it. The FOV of the Quest isn't alot better then the Rift S but it feels so much better and immersive while the Rift S takes me complete out of the immersion. So I even prefer to play with the Quest through Oculus Link then with the Rift S.

Some people might say it's because of my IPD (it's not I have 63)  or because of the cover and it's not close enaugh to my eyes but no, I am able to put the headset that close to my eyes until I see all 4 edges of the screen, it looks like I'm watching through a carboard box which is even more immersiom breaking, and still the FOV is much smaller then the Quest while I can't see any edges of the Quest.

&amp;#x200B;

So that is the only reason why I bought the Index. I really like the Oculus software, the tracking, the controllers, and the screen of the Rift S but the FOV is just too small for me.

&amp;#x200B;

What do you think of the FOV?

The Quest seemed to have the most bang for buck on the market because of its standalone and pc link capabillities.

Pros compared to the gear vr:
- coming from a Gear vr positional tracking is a game changer foe me
- everything seems clearer, more optimized and snappier
- i love the 3d outside camera
- having hands inside the quest, much much better than the gear vr controller
- link
- standalone
- i use floorplanner.com for floorplans and now im able to walk around in the 360 vr exports of my floorplans

Cons compared to the Gear vr:
- there is some light refraction visible on the lenses
- there is some space around my nose where outside light comes trough
- eye strain after 10 minutes which worse and worse untill im unable to use the quest around the 15 min mark

Other cons:
- sometimes the controllers touch eachother, especially in boxing games",1575814893.0,3,5,196792

It's the old Question... What should I get for Christmas?

I mainly want to play games and watch Movies with my future headset. 
The Quest has apperently more opportunities but the Rift is more comfortable. 


And because it matters: I have a gaming Laptop with a RTX 2060. And I am a guy who enjoys having good graphics

Have a 1070 ti, i7-4790, 16 gigs of ram and in Stormland if I run it on medium or high settings the frame rate drops to 40hz in most places and aws kicks in. I have to run it on low settings to get 80 hz. What would improve my performance the most, a CPU upgrade since that is older? I thought the 1070 ti was still in the top 10 cards.

oculus,Oculus should really release more facial interfaces for the Rift S or at least release some CAD files so other can do so.,"My biggest gripe with my VR experience lately is that the facial interface just doesn't fit my face well and it's not very comfortable compared to my old CV1.  I have bought every 3rd party accessory I can find to improve the comfort but at the end of the day, the thing is just not shaped right for my face.   Maybe one day VR cover will release a new plastic interface, but I feel like this is an easier problem for Oculus themselves to solve, and an important one to address if they want to continue to grow the user base.

If you want to reduce friction to get people into VR, comfort is REALLY important.  I can be playing the best game in the world but if I'm feeling discomfort ON MY FACE of all places it's kinda hard to keep playing.  The HMD is a piece of clothing basically and the facial interface is where the HMD meets the face, it's really important, but so far is has not really been treated as such.

I see a lot of people on here over the years with the same problem and it seems pretty obvious it needs to be addressed.  People have all kinds of different face shapes and a one size fits all solution is doomed to leave many people uncomfortable.  

 All that Facebook money is great for doing the big R&amp;D stuff like varifocal lenses and cool new robot vision, but this problem is just molding some plastic a few different ways so people can be more comfortable.  This is low hanging fruit, but a big deal to the users.  

At the very least outsource the problem to the community and let us solve it but with some support from Oculus to help.  3d printers are pretty common, just give out the specs for printing the snaps so people can build their own and maybe sell them on etsy or something.  Or just sell a plastic plate with the snaps that we can glue our own solution to.  Or go all next level and do some kinda face scanning software that lets us 3d print a custom fit plate, that would be so Batman/Carmack.  And on the next headset, the magnetic snaps like the Index is using are a good idea, just copy that and make it easy for us.

I have been able to get the controllers to pair sometimes, after restarts task managers and fiddling, but most of the time I am stuck on the screen...

&amp;#x200B;

When I even get into VR I am left without sound.

&amp;#x200B;

Help?

oculus,Torn about getting a Rift S,"The Rift S is on sale at the moment in my country, meaning I can it for about $400, bringing it down to match the US price. 
It still seems quite exspensive for what it is though, and the reviews are pretty mixed for this product. So I'm worried.
  
The things that worry me are:. 
1: Low field of view. 2: visible pixels. 3: Bad sound quality. 4: washed out blacks. 5: cheap foam that can't be removed. 
  
My IPD is 63.5mm, so I guess that would be ideal?
  
I'm also thinking that it might be better to wait for a future product that could be better, but perhaps that won't happen for a long time?
  
Only other VR I tried is is Odyssey Plus, which had good black levels and a decent field of view, but I didn't like the extreme blurriness around the edges and the tiny sweet spot on the lens.

oculus,I'm happy to say Boiling Steel is really good.,"If you like Sci fi shooters, killing lots of robots and just having a good time, this game might be for you.

Boiling steel is really fun imho. I have played it now for about 2-3 hours and I'm nowhere near the end.
It starts off somewhat basic, lots of boring dialogue and initially the shooting seems kinda basic. But the more you play you realize this part of the game was essentially an extended tutorial.

The real game starts after the third or so mission, maybe about 30 to 40 min. After that the game greatly opens up, allowing you to select your own mission and even do bonus missions for special rewards. 

The way the game works you are essentially a human who operates robots remotely. Something happens at the beginning of the game that makes all sorts of robots go crazy and attack the humans. It is up to you to find out what happened and how to fix it. I can't say much about the story but at this point I'm certainly intrigued and want to see where it goes. I've already seen one or two revelations  that intrigued me.


You go in missions, get rewards and upgrade your robot and your weapons. This ain't an rpg but there's certainly a progression system that you feel yourself getting stronger and more capable. 

The starting weapons are extremely weak and little by little they are getting better. But one of the most interesting things of the game is how you equip/ reload these weapons. 

You basically hold the grip button of your non dominant hand and a hologram shows up with your long range and your short range weapon. Then with your other hand you grip the hologram and expand it. Then the weapon materializes in your hand.  According to the story they are being ""teleported"" from somewhere. There's no reloading. Once the weapon runs out of ammo you have to do this all over again. 

So far all the weapons I've gotten are two handed but they are all pretty varied and have different handling and uses. 

The missions are usually pretty basic, go here, unlock this, open this gate etc but the combat is what really shines. Theres several types of enemies and they are pretty good at taking cover, throwing grenades and rushing you. 

Overall the combination of the combat, the weapon system, the story, the progression has made this game pretty enjoyable for me. 

For 20 bucks, you hardly can go wrong. I'm playing this on viveport and the viveport version actually supports oculus home from what I can tell. Runs as smooth as any native oculus game that I've seen. No hitches or anything. And also a lot of settings to tweak for comfort etc (game defaults to headset orientation) 

Give it a try, I'm sure if you are a fan of single player  shooters you will enjoy this a lot.

Edit : apparently the game is about 4 to 5 hours long according to the dev with more hours to be added as the game progresses in early access. (probably should have mentioned it is early access)

Another big criticism is that the game is definitely budget and indie. A lot of the voice acting is actually text to speech (a computer is talking to you). And the levels are reused for the missions.",1575761128.0,6,1,196792

oculus,"Just did the SteamVR Performance test, and did pretty well for myself. Then why does my Rift S run like a diabetic quadriplegic?","I acquired the Rift S in November, and have yet to get it to work properly. Initially, the screen didn't work, then I fixed that issue. It was a VBIOS issue. Resolved. Now it's an issue with what I would describe as ""blurry lag"" that Oculus Support hasn't really been much help with.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem goes like this: set up my Rift to be used. Plug it in, boot up the Oculus home software. Launch a game. See that the game is running okay for a moment or two before looking around becomes unbearably jarring. Blur around the hands and anything else that's moving. I can see outside the field of view, into the void of crushed dreams.

&amp;#x200B;

AWS has been disabled and re-enabled countless times. I've overclocked my GPU. I've overclocked my memory. I've defragged my SSD and HDD. I've updated drivers. I've rolled back drivers. I've re-pasted my GPU and CPU. I've sold my soul to the lord of the underworld. I've cast spells.

I'm considering just selling my Rift S and giving up on VR until I can afford a better computer.

oculus,N1NE: The Splintered Mind Development Update - Change of release plans and new gameplay screenshots,"Hi everyone,

First off, we’d just like to say thanks to everyone who has supported us so far and welcome any newcomers to N1NE: The Splintered Mind.

We’re so grateful for all the support and feedback for the game we’ve received since we released our Alpha reveal trailer.

Today we are making an [announcement](https://www.od1nstudios.com/n1ne-the-splintered-mind-development-update/) that the team here has thought long and hard about. It’s not an easy decision for us but we feel it’s the best way for us to deliver a game that has a level of quality we as a team can be proud of.

And so, we are delaying the release of N1NE: The Splintered Mind Part 1.

We’d like to explain our decision making process in hopes of better communicating with all of you and strike a level of understanding for why we made the choice.

We also want to give you an update on where we are at and a look into the game, so we've written a blog post on our website with some additional info and new screenshots.

oculus,Unpopular Opinion - I prefer Rift S to Valve Index,"Hey All, fairly new to VR here. Little backstory  

&amp;#x200B;

I ordered a Valve index a few weeks ago, and was super excited. Boneworks, then HL:A, and Asgards Wrath (through Revive), I was just so excited! So excited in fact... That I couldn't wait to jump in, and ran out and bought a Rift S to play in the meantime, and maybe gift to my nephew once my Valve Index got in. I have been OBSESSED! I spent a ton of money on the steam VR sales, black friday oculus sales, and have been having a blast. But in the back of my mind was always the thought - ""This is going to be so much better when my Index comes in!""

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to this last Monday, got my Index, set it up (pain in the ass) and started playing. I was immediately disappointing. my first complaint was how much heavier the headset feels compared to my Rift S. It's noticeable, and I was constantly aware of it. Second issue - my play space is too small for the Steam VR ""full room scale"" chaperone set up (Valve's version of guardian"" so I couldn't even use it! I love my Rift S guardian, and has saved my ass a ton of times when playing Blade and Sorcery! Third issue, the cables dangling genuinely felt heavier, I noticed them more. It's a thicker cord, it weighs more than the Rift S, and it's noticeable. Forth issue (and it's a big one) I kept noticing these massive shines coming through my lenses while playing.. Like glare of some kind. I thought I had a defective unit, until I learned that it's something called ""Godrays"" and BOY is it bad. Like, REALLY bad when comparing to my Rift S. it was a constant distraction and I noticed it all of the time. 

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly? The amazing Oculus exclusives, eco system, recent innovations coming out of the Oculus team, makes me really excited about the future and investing into the Oculus eco system. Yeah, the on-board speakers suck ass, but I have a really good computer speaker set up, and just crank the volume when playing in my office and it works fine for me. 

Is it just me? Am I crazy? i don't get what is so amazing about the Index? 

Anyways, that's my two cents. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - I much prefer the Oculus Rift S over the Valve Index having owned both of them, and will be returning the Index for a refund.",1575694071.0,30,68,196792

Every time I switch it off I am never in the center of the view, it's always to the right of me. If I goto the Steam VR settings, reset my seating view, reset my head view and I am back in the center - the Steam view you see before entering a game with the stars, distant mountains and a grey area at your feet - this grey area is in the center. Run a game, any of the above games I mentioned, and I am back to left of the grey area - so as I look down it's to the right of my view. So, in any of the games, I am either outside the car, outside my ship in ED, outside of any sitting down game.  
Of course, I can't just move to the right because my PC is where I need to be sat at, so a move to the right and I am not sitting at my PC.  
At the moment, the only way out of this is to switch the Guardian system back on, grab a chair and sit directly in the middle, but then my PC is way to the left of me.  
This is just so damn frustrating because one would think that switching OFF the Guardian system would also switch off any need to have a center of anything, the center should always be your headset.

oculus,Nostos First Impressions,"FYI: I never played the beta but heard some pretty bad things from the community and recently from Eric for President. I decided to give it a go anyway.

I played it for \~15-20 excruciating minutes, and then had to stop because it was so unenjoyable. Couldn't run it on high settings--it was a stuttering mess, so I turned it to low. Still a stuttering, janky mess. It's the kind of nauseating thing that VR games often do when they're loading, where a still image flickers rapidly and you become disoriented as you move your head. Let it be known that this game doesn't give you advanced video options. It's just Low-Medium-High.

The first red flag is at the very start, where this little robot thing asks you to calibrate yourself, then asks if you can see yourself in the mirror. It motions at the ground as if to tell the mirror to come up and, as if in an attempt to be funny and charming, the mirror doesn't show up until 10 seconds later. The arms on my girl avatar, according to the mirror, was way off. When I had my hands by my side IRL, the model had its right hand in her body toward the middle.

When you finally enter the game, you get this wrist watch thing ever so slightly reminiscent of what you get from Stormlands but not nearly as functional or just plain good. You can access it sometimes, other times, you can't. I tried changing graphics options from inside the options menu, but couldn't. The only way to do so is to return to the menu screen.

Let's talk about controls/gameplay. Maybe it's just me, but moving around felt like there was some sort of input lag so you end up gliding forward much longer than you want to. To run, you hold the grip which launches you every which way, making it even hard to control where you are. I played as a dude and somehow, some way, without clear directions, ended up in the open wild. Decided to shoot some deer with the pistol they gave me but I had to lead my shots an unreasonable amount. It dropped a slab of meat. Once I ran out of ammo, I had a landmine at my disposal, but it was virtually useless. Two bandits came up to me and started shooting me so I tried to punch them--there was audio feedback, but their HP didn't appear to go down. Once they'd shot me to the ground, one of the npcs game to my aid but started losing the battle, so I was left on the floor to die.

There's no tutorial to speak of, which left me confused about how things worked. That's not a good sign.

Over voice-chat, you can hear people going, ""What the \*\*\*\* is this? How do you do this/that? What's going on? Why is it loading forever?""

For what it's worth, it's a good looking game and from what I saw in the main hub, seems like there's a decent amount of people trying Nostos out too.

But this doesnt feel early-access. This feels early-*early* access.

For those of you who've tried it, what are your thoughts?",1575681615.0,11,11,196792

We released new free DLC for Swords of Gargantua, called Tesseract Abyss!

It's a rogue-lite mode that can be done solo or through multiplayer. Players move downwards into the ""abyss"" fighting in different areas that are chosen from a random selection after each stage.

Along the way you'll earn power-ups, can collect weapons, craft them into stronger weapons and level up your own character's base abilities. There'll even be a shop that appears from time to time which you can buy items (like power-ups and health) through the coin you earn by winning battles.

If you die, you'll carry everything over into the next play minus your initial level. It's pretty tricky so you'll most likely die a few times. Looking forward to seeing everyone progress through it!

Please check it out and let me know what you think!

oculus,How to Narrow Down the Right VR Headset,"For the last week I have been on a VR rampage, getting my hands on several different headsets in order to find the best experience for me. To find the headset I would be willing to live with for the next few years. I had read reviews, did my research, but I felt a lot of the feedback I was hearing was unfocused. People were hesitant to recommend things because things weren't 100% good about any one headset. Conversely, there were many things that people valued far more or less than others. Well, I want to solve that problem by narrowing down use cases. You decide what is most important to you by seeing what scenario fits. This is, of course, from my own perspective.

*You will need to know some basic information about the Steam Index, Oculus Rift S, and Oculus Quest to make sense of this guide.*

**Pre-Requisites:**

What do you need prior to playing VR with the kits below?

* Index: Super Computer. 1080/2080+
* Rift S: Gaming computer. 1060/2060+
* Quest: None. All in one solution.

**Mobility:**

A rating of how easy it is to move your configuration. The wired headsets here are not too difficult to play in seeing as the wires are greatly improved from last gen, so that's less of an issue.

* Index: Dedicated space recommended. Since it uses tracking beacons the best way to get them to work is to mount them. Wires need to be managed regardless of if they are mounted on a wall or a tripod. Moving this system is definitely going to take effort and it's unlikely you will want to move around with this system. If you don't have a dedicated space, or can't see yourself playing in the same space more than 80% of the time, this will be troublesome.
* Rift S: Mobile. The wire is very manageable, and with a dedicated VR laptop (That needs Mini-DisplayPort connected to your GPU) you can be mobile. The headset has all the tracking tools built in, so you are surprisingly mobile. Play downstairs one minute and upstairs the next.
* Quest: Absolute Freedom. VR makes a lot of people conscious and worrisome about the world around them. Well, with the Quest, you have zero wires. It's the future of VR on a general level.

**Comfort:**

* Index: Very comfortable. A little heavy, but felt well balanced. Did not wobble. Best materials.
* Rift S: Comfortable. I would argue very comfortable, but the halo ratchet didn't always feel secure. I did not like the foam as much as the Index's cotton layered padding. Will definitely need Silicone or VR Cover.
* Quest: Comfortable. Most similar to the CV1 in terms of attachment. It requires a lot of fidgeting to get right, but I never had a need for a counter weight once I figured it out. I think people overstress the added ""weight"" as it's only \~70g heavier than the CV1 in the front. It probably helps because it adheres to your face more. There is more wobble on the Quest than the Rift S, but at the same time there are better comfort accessories for the Quest too. If you spend more money the Quest might edge out the Index.

**Visuals:**

* Index: A+. The best visuals I tried. No god rays, just light blooming. Don't be fooled by the fact that it's an LCD because when it comes to VR LCD is king. Don't mistake your monitor's contrast ratio with this thing. Just like TVs have specially adapted pixel configurations to increase contrast (or your iPad for instance), the VR headsets have the same. LCD has less banding, no speckle, and far less SDE. The improved refresh rate of the Index makes it the king of the three. If you get motion sick, the Index is the only headset that may resolve it.
* Rift S: A. Everything above, other than the refresh rate and FOV, applies here. This headset's visuals are not that far off from the Index and that's due to the lenses. The best analogy I can make is a 23"" 1080P monitor and a 27"" 1440P monitor. It's obvious the latter is higher resolution and more dense, but because the 1080P screen is smaller the density is similar (\~97 vs \~109 PPI) the difference isn't mind shattering. The reduced refresh rate is noticeable for owners of the CV1, but it doesn't harm the gaming experience. That being said, I own the 1440p monitor in this example and even though it's only 12 PPI that mattered to me. You might be the same?
* Quest: B. If you've used the CV1, you can think of this as a CV1+. It's unfair to say it isn't different, because text is far easier to read and god rays are greatly reduced, but there are similar OLED issues that remain. SDE is reduced but far more noticeable than the above headsets. Brightness suffers as a result. 72hz is noticeable, but has yet to affect gameplay for me. If you suffer motion sickness this headset might not be for you at all. There isn't jitter, but movement isn't as smooth. Pistol Whip is hard to play compared to on CV1. The B rating is above average though, so we're at a place where visuals aren't something you are suffering through, but simply something better exists.

**Controls:**

I don't think this is a significant talking point. I don't prefer the Oculus controllers versus the old CV1, but they aren't bad. Valve's controllers have additional features but they aren't really necessary in the VR world currently. You're getting a quality controller regardless fo what platform you pick.

**Value:**

* Rift S and Quest are the best value. The Index is a luxury item in my standards. For the money you pay, it delivers. But at some point you are happy with your iPhone X and don't need an iPhone XI. When you buy a Rift S or a Quest you aren't buying yesterday's product either, so there's no sense of ""I wasted money on old tech"". You are buying the newest products that Oculus has to offer. Valve's product is better, but not a better value.

**Sound:**

The Index is the only VR headset with a real audio solution. I'm a little weird in that I like the Rift S' open audio because it allows me to be more aware of my surroundings (and it's immersive because you hear audio without having your ears covered) but that's not the norm. I like it, but I still prefer the Index. Hell, even the CV1's headphones were great and they are missed.

With both the Rift S and the Quest you will need to invest money in another audio solution if you want headsets.

**Quest Link (beta):**

This is specifically for the Quest, but it's usually the most difficult topic regarding getting the Rift S or the Quest. For most people, the lower visual quality of the Quest in Link is worth the mobility and freedom. They just need to make sure Quest Link WORKS.

Quest Link is solid.

If you're playing native Quest apps and you have no issues with the loss of visual fidelity there (due to the mobile processor) and you just want to make sure you can play Half Life: Alyx or some other PCVR titles -- you're good. It works wonderfully for a beta. It's plug and play. The visuals are still great.

However, if you're thinking you want to be playing PCVR more often; if you bought a beefy GPU because you wanted awesome VR graphics and crisp visuals... Quest Link isn't that. It's like playing 1080p games on your 4K monitor. It looks fine, but it's noticeable. 

If you want Quest as a Quest, Link is an added bonus that feels like cheating at life. If you want Quest as some sort of value proposition between your gaming PC and Mobile VR, it's doable without major complaints. If you think Quest Link compares or replaces Rift S/Index in experience however, you're going to be very sorely disappointed. **I have no idea how so many youtubers and reviewers could ever say playing Quest Link felt no different than Rift S.** Just 1 minute in Link and I could easily tell. I'm not some magical gamer -- you'd have to be blind not to know. Whether you care or not is not the same as there being almost no literal difference. That is ***absolute bullshit***.

Perhaps they will fix it in future updates, but Quest Link has slight glitching in visuals every so often. Sometimes objects teleport a few inches (in game perspective) as the stream takes time to catch up during intense gameplay. Vader Immortal's Dojo showed this often when critters would pop up and move around. There's also a very, very slight lag in audio and controllers. I'd say you will never choose to play Beat Saber over Link. Score or Performance didn't drop for me much, but you notice the visual glitches. You will actively recognize that a block sliced open a little closer to your face than you're used to. However, you might be fine playing a game that is intense but not nearly as rapid -- like Stormland or Elder Scrolls VR. Using Half Life as an example again, I can see myself playing it over Link without many complaints.

**What Did I Pick?**

Playing *more* VR supercedes playing *better* VR, in my opinion. This is why I moved on from the CV1 to begin with; the increased visual fidelity was merely an unexpected bonus. While I fell in love with the Valve Index, I don't have a dedicated play area. I have to move between two spots depending on my opportunities so that narrows down my choice. Picking between Rift S and Quest was difficult, but I ended up deciding on the Rift S. Quest is fun without a tether, but I have a gaming laptop and the cord doesn't bother me so much. It feels no different to me than having wired earbuds on.

Happy Holidays and I hope you all find the headset you need!",1575665191.0,12,11,196792

oculus,Oculus Rift S Headphone Jack Audio Issues,"So ever since I bought the Rift S I've absolutely loved it. I think the one persistent issue I've noticed since opening the Rift S is that my Apple Earpod headphones don't seem to want to sound right unless the jack is sitting in an absolutely specific position often moving back out of position during play which results in audio cutting out of the right headphone.  Sometimes even only plugging it in halfway will give me better audio in both headphones than all the way in which will cut out most of the right headphone unless you twist it just right.

And no, the headphones work perfectly fine in any other device and are not damaged near the jack. The Rift S Headphone Jack is super touchy with jack position. I usually only get this issue with cheap 3.5mm headphone extenders previously. More higher quality 3.5mm extension cords don't have this issue like the current one I'm using for my PC audio into these very headphones that give me issues on the Rift S jack.",1575702097.0,2,2,196792

I ran the 'Oculus checker' software and my PC meets specs (nvidia GTX1060, 16G ram, USB 3, etc).

Has anyone else had this problem and been able to resolve it? I'm pretty upset that after buying it and making sure my laptop was fine that it's not working.

Edit: not sure why people are down voting this... with the black Friday sales I'm sure other people are likely facing the same issue.

So im in th emarked for a vr headset, and its down between the Quest and the Rift S. The issue is, im not gonna keep my pc in the same room as i would like to VR in. The computer room is to small to do much flailing around, and i dont wanna keep my pc in the living room, because i use it for other stuff besides gaming. So i need about 5-6m extension on the cables. Its also one of the reasons i dont care for the Index, cause id need to run a ton of cabling trough the middle of my apartment. 

Has anyone tried this? Would it be easier to extend the link with an active usb 3 cable? Or the rift S with a display port repeater and some aditional cabling? Would any of those options even work? At this point this seems to be the deciding factor for me, cause they both seem to have a bunch of advantages and disadvantages.

oculus,Don't sleep on Boiling Steel!,"We are suddenly blessed with tons of really good VR content. My library is already a guilt ridden mountain of unfinished games. Recently, we have had some real hard hitters - finding time to play though Asgards Wrath and Stormlands is hard enough. So, this is the first year I passed on the sales - I just do not need any new games. 

Then Boiling Steel comes along. I had my eye on this for some time, saw a couple of enthusiastic reviews (well, 'let's play's'). I thought, 'this game seems legit' - but I stood my ground... no new games 'till I clear some of the back catalogue.

Then I noticed Boiling Steel pop up on Infinity - so I downloaded it. Now I am going to buy it on Steam (Infinity - for me = good for demoing games that I will buy on Steam if I like them). 

Everything about this game puts it up there with the very best VR shooters (perhaps... even my current darling: Stormlands).

Graphics are really, I mean \*really\* good. Gameplay is solid and innovative, and everything about it just 'feels right'. 

There is a very different feel to most shooters (VR or not). You see, there are no health packs lying around (if you think about it - having convenient health packs just lying around - is pretty dumb, unrealistic and immersion breaking in any game). *Here* you have to conserve your health - get though by playing smart and taking as few hits as possible. Dash, forward to hit, or dash back to evade - fight more tactically. This gives the game some genuine tension and sense of achievement. There is no - 'I'll kill this guy, pick up his health pack and suddenly, I am 100% again'. 

The only bad thing so far is the voice acting - the main GI Joe voice is like fingernails on a blackboard. But that's it - everything else is up there with the very best. 

Putting this game out now is poor timing - had this come out before AW and Stormlands - I am pretty sure everyone would be flagging it up - and I fear many will pass, or not even notice what is a truly great game.

Owned an Oculus for about a year and I love it.

Problem is, I'm not sure what. My PC has basically been hammered together over several years, I'm not even really sure what's in there at this point but a system scan tells me I'm running:

Radeon RX Vega 

16 GB DDR3 RAM

Windows 10 64bit

I'm budgeting about £500 and I'd like to put in an SSD to improve loading times ( especially for Asgards wrath my 2 year old 2TB drive really doesn't like loading that game ) but should I go for more RAM or a faster CPU ? I could get a new graphics card but the Vega is only about a year old and should handle stuff pretty well.

No Man's Sky has exhibited some noticeable issues on my W10 system, which consists of:

i5 6600k (Stock)
Sapphire Nitro+ 5700XT 8GB OC
16gb DDR4 

Based on some light research, NMS in VR is very CPU intensive due to the nature of the game itself, which matches up with the issues I've had (slow to render/black portion of view when quickly moving head, stuttering when moving at high speed, and during star field intro/loading screen).

In search of a solution, I'm debating which upgrade path is the best and most cost effective for my predicament. The i7 7700k is the fastest CPU my LGA1151 board will accommodate. Can I expect this to provide a noticeable boost and the alleviation of these issues, or should I spend some more for a new AM4 motherboard with a Ryzen 3800x?

I tried Microsoft verifier, sfc scannow, memtest, checked drive for errors etc... No issues anywhere. It doesn't matter what cable I connect to the sensor, it just BSOD the moment the sensor turns on (config window or in-game) but does appear to work for a brief second.

My computer is quite powerful and I have more RAM to know what I can do with. It all started after the update and I can't revert nor would I want to. :(

oculus,360 degree video app that allows perspective change via controller in addition to head movement?,"I have an Oculus Go, I'm a very casual VR user, and I've been taking more and more 360 video since getting my Gear 360. Often I want to view this content in bed, on the couch, etc. where there are kinda constraints on moving around enough to see from any perspective. I say ""kinda"" because of course I \*could\* get up and move around, I just don't wanna, it's more effort than I want to expend.

The same thing would occur if you wanted to use the headset in an airplane seat. I imagine you'd have less than 180 degrees of head movement, you could become a pain to your seat neighbors pretty quickly. For a lot of casual content, even some games (i.e. Eclipse, Monument Valley), being able to control the perspective from the controller would be nice.

It's surprised me that almost no apps (that I've encountered so far) allow perspective change like this from the controller also.

What would be REALLY nice is some way at the system level of the Go to enable this sort of override for any/all content. This has to exist already, right? If a physically impaired user wants to use a headset, granted the immersion will suffer a bit, but this seems like a perfectly acceptable tweak to the navigation model.

The one exception to this I've seen so far is the Netflix app, in the mode where the ersatz room disappears (void?). I like that to occasionally watch video laying flat in bed. It's not exactly what I'm describing, but it feels close, at least in spirit.",1575647283.0,2,2,196792

Short version is that my first headset was quite simply, defective. The cable connection at the headset was extremely finicky and if you turned slightly it would disconnect. I plugged it back in multiple times, tried different display ports, different USB ports, even a powered USB hub, nothing worked. I also had the issue where my headset would occasionally stop tracking my hands and they would lock in place.

So after many hours troubleshooting, I returned it and ordered another. Got it today and works awesome! No issues setting up or with tracking, no black outs/ shutting off, and the connection to the headset is firm.

It's an absolute blast to get to play with a rift s that actually works lol. For anyone wondering, I play robo recall, Pavlov, and blade and sorcery.

oculus,(Rift S)Can we talk about this - Oculus Software Restart Required,"Many of you may have seen or heard about this issue, many others, like myself, may be one of the victims. If you have not heard about this issue, it is a problem that plagues primarily the Rift S from what I can tell. The problem seems to arise after a PC reboot after setting up the Rift S for the first time. When the Oculus Software starts, a notification appears on the Devices tab showing an issue with the Rift S. Clicking on the Rift S shows a message which says ""Oculus Software Restart Required"". Restarting all of the Oculus Software and services does not fix this message no matter how many times it is done, and the headset is unusable when in this state (black screen).

A quick Google search for Oculus Rift S Software Restart Required will reveal dozens of posts on various forums detailing this issue dating all the way back to late March and early June, right around the Rift S release. All of the many posts I've seen are filled with conjecture, hypotheses, and mundane troubleshooting steps which leave users in no better shape and no real answers. Some think it's due to USB driver versions, some think it's a power draw issue, some think it's an Oculus Software bug (my opinion), others think it's due to outdated graphics drivers or windows updates, but no one really knows. This issue has been affecting many users since launch, and the lack of any official statement by Oculus is concerning to say the least.

I'd like to hear from those of you who may have experienced this problem. If you created an Oculus Support ticket, what was the provided solution? Did the provided solution fix the issue? Did you try any troubleshooting yourself? Did any of those steps fix the issue? When did you start experiencing this, and what are the symptoms? I'm making this post to bring this up for open discussion, and hopefully bring some visibility to/for the community, because there are currently a very alarming amount of $400 bricks on people's desks.",1575555987.0,35,58,196792

As VR in recent years has received so much stick for being so expensive pc-wise. What if oculus or another company were to take the average pc with fairly equal power to the 835 and put in the capability to connect a headset and play quest quality vr games. This would open the VR market to basically anyone with a pc and willing to buy a heaset (if you get a wmr heaset that’s only £200 to get into VR). If oculus or other company were able to get the developers on board, then you would be able to play the whole library of quest games, on limited pc power, and with an ecosystem mostly built. It would also result in more developers diving in and investing more into VR and the quest would get many more titles. Oculus - are you listening? Open VR to the average person.

oculus,How does the Force Tube VR compare to PS Aim controller,"I have 2 Rift CV1s and 2 Gos. However, I saw on Black Friday a PS4 Pro for EUR 280 and I got a second hand PSVR + aim controller + 2 PS Moves + games for EUR 150 so I had to jump in.

For the record, I love gun controllers for games. I have the PS Sharpshooter for PS3 (Killzone 3 is fantastic with it). I even have a MAG II gun for PC and I experimented with wiimotes https://youtu.be/8OcXppjEgi8 and https://youtu.be/GyYm1s6y4RY. I got the PS4 Pro and the PSVR mainly for the aim controller. For VR I have the standard ProTube.

First some thoughts on PSVR and Farpoint. What can I say, apart from the fixed IPD (blurry edges with my 70mm IPD), having those early-game spidery things in Farpoint jump at me in a headcrab-like arc really gave me a chill down the spine. I have not felt that recently. And splashing them mid-air with the aim controller was such fun! For some reason, the robotic spiders in Robo Recall do not elicit the same primal reaction.

The haptics on the aim controller are quite good and really bring that feeling of actually holding and shooting a gun. Unfortunately, with the ProTube I get almost no haptics. The vibrations of the Touch controllers are very, very weak and they are even less noticeable when the touch controllers are in the ProTube cups.

So I have a question: does the ForceTube work well? Does it work in all games? How does it compare to other controllers like the PSVR aim controller and the PS Sharpshooter?",1575618283.0,1,0,196792

oculus,CV1 to Rift S - First Impressions,"I have tried the Rift S before briefly, and wasn’t sure about the comfort, but my wife got me one for Black Friday, so here are my impressions.  I am a 67-68 IPD

Also, to qualify this, I last used my Rift CV1 a couple days ago and won’t be able to use it again until next week (for reasons) so I can’t compare them directly.

Visual Quality

Awesome.  Huge improvement over the CV1.  The SDE is still there, but vastly improved and often not noticeable.  I thought the colors were just fine despite it not being an OLED.  I didn’t try it in Elite Dangerous or another super dark game though.  Clarity around the screen was great too.  Couldn’t get both eyes 100% focused but seemed clear when using it.  It did seem very slightly off though, hard to explain, I think because my IPD is too wide?  Not enough to notice 90% of the time, the the visuals were a huge bump up.
As for God Rays, they are massively reduced.  You can still see streaks of light from high contrast objects, but they are much fainter and softer, just a slight smear of light.

Comfort

The halo was comfortable once I got it set up.  The only drawback was it seemed like it took a lot more fiddling with it when I put it on.  The CV1 I could just slip on.

Tracking

Amazing.  I was expecting a slight downgrade from the CV1, but honestly it seemed as good or better.  I was sword fighting in Until You Fall (unrelated note, every one in awhile that game pauses with the hourglass figure, anyone know how to fix that?) and had zero problems.  Same with Robo Recall.  The setup was simple too.  

Audio

Ok, this is a downgrade.  Not as bad as I  feared (my previous demo was in a noisy store so couldn't tell then) but it is still a downgrade.  Not horrible though, you can still hear clearly.

Eye Strain

In a previous post I mentioned that I felt the Rift S caused some eye strain for me when I demoed it.  I spent some time trying different fittings to reduce that.  But after playing awhile, I am still feeling it.  I didn’t have this problem with the CV1.  I think it is just the price I will have to pay for a wider IPD.

I will update this next week after I have had more time to play and have my CV1 hooked up again to compare side by side.

Update 1 - I was asked about blurriness at the edges of the lens.  I don't think it is bad.  I mean yes it gets distorted when you look at the far edge of the lense, but it has a big sweet spot where it is very clear to look around with your eyes.",1575570028.0,9,21,196792

Like many, I recently got an Oculus Rift S on black friday, and trying to be a perfectionist about it looked for accessories for it. I was disappointed to see that there weren't a lot of options on the market. I ordered the AMVR grips, which I will hopefully not regret (I barely saw other options here either), but the one thing I heard people talking about is that you should use a washable cover for the Rift S due to hygiene reasons. On further research I have seen that the one offered by VR Cover (which I heard was the best for these kind of things) for the Rift S was just a simple cloth you strap over. 

&amp;#x200B;

For the price it costs, it would cost just as much to just get a replacement headplate for the Rift S in case I needed one - and the VR Cover one also has basically no reviews to be found anywhere online. So I'm asking here: Anyone with experience - is the VR Cover worth it and are there better alternatives or other must-have accessories to further improve the care of my new (and first) VR headset.

oculus,New to VR and not sure if I'm having a hardware problem,"I just purchases the Rift S and I'm super happy with it so far. The only problem I've encountered, is a small vertical white line  at the extreme edge of my left eye. 

It's most noticeable when I'm just in a the virtual desktop. It's just a split second vertical line that I can see ""out of the corner of my eye"". 

 In the few games it's there, but easily ignore able unless I focus on it. .  Is this just something that sometimes happens or something I can correct by changing a setting? 

It's a minor distraction, and honestly if happened on both sides I would probably assume it's just a refresh issue and move on. Since it's only happening in one eye though, I thought it might be something I'm doing or a hardware issue.

So my Surface Book 2 is incompatible with the Rift S because the GPU doesn't have direct access to the USB-C DisplayPort Alt Mode. As such, I'm only able to play through my desktop.

Since I just bought the Rift S, I'm within my window to return it.

I'm curious, though: How do the graphics compare between the Quest by itself and through Oculus Link? I have the 5700 XT, so I'm hoping for much better graphics when I connect to my desktop.

oculus,Day One with Rift S. :),"Well, today I finally, after waiting like 5 years to get a headset, got the Rift S.

I also got the Sapphire Nitro+ 5700XT.

I've only used the headset for a few hours, around 6, and everything seems to be working great.

I played First Step, it has you push buttons on the controller, but there is a long delay between each scripted event, it kept making me think the thing had froze.  The desk comes out of the floor, and you have cubes to play with. Throw a paper airplane, and play with ping pong paddle and ball.

Then I noticed that it was awfully quiet, there was no sound. So I wanted to take the headset off, and decided to put the controllers on the desk in front of me, till I remember it wasn't real. LOL! Almost dropped them on the floor! Yikes!

The little flying robot felt like he was there, like I could reach out and touch him! Very cool!

When I first put the headset on, I was sitting down, and I started the wrong game, I meant First Step, but played the next one after that one. The floor was wrong, and I was up near the ceiling. I wanted to stand up, and get in place in my room, but there was equipment around my head, and it seemed so real, that my brain was telling me not to stand up, your going to smash your face into that. LOL!!! Unreal!

Anyway, after I took a break for food, and looked up some info, and then installed Steam VR. Very easy to do.

I had bought Space Pirate Trainer, a game I've been wanting to play for years now. :) Took all of about 2 mins to install Steam VR, and Space Pirate Trainer, and I was playing. Very smooth. I had less trouble with Steam, than Home. In Home, I couldn't find a way to recenter my view, so I had to face odd directions to play. Steam, made it very easy. 

Great game, the tracking is awesome. The guns in my hand seemed real, because they followed my every movement, as fast as I was moving them. I was holding the shield with the controller like under my chin, hiding behind the shield, and never lost tracking, I never lost tracking since I got the headset for that matter! :) Oh, and I played the whole time lying on my back!! :) I was tired, long day. :) Worked great though.

Then I used the Virtual Desktop in Home to watch a YouTube video. I made the screen huge. Video quality was great, like no screen door effect at all. Much better than I thought. I honestly never read anyone say how good the picture was, they always seemed disappointed.... After seeing it for myself, I don't understand their reaction.

People complain about the blacks, and the sound. The blacks are black enough, they aren't perfect, but very far from being a game breaker, and the sound is good, nice 3D Spatial audio, no you don't get hard bass, but you get a bit, I can live with it.

Zero motion sickness. I'm farsighted, and had zero trouble seeing with the Rift S. My eyes never got tired.

Computer Stats:
950watt Power supply, was running two GTX 480's, that's what I just upgraded from. :)
3770K CPU
Sapphire Nitro+ 5700XT 3 times faster than my 480's. :)
32gigs of ram
Inateck Superspeed 7 Ports PCI-E to USB 3.0 Expansion Card KT5002 using the far left port, if you're facing the back of your computer.

Make sure you usb ports power save is disabled. I had done it, but for some reason, it turned back on. Which caused the screen to go black, I had put the headset down for a few minutes, and wouldn't wake up when I put the headset back on. Had to reboot, this happened a couple of times, after that I rechecked those settings, and had to turn them off again....

Question, how do you watch a video, without hearing the crackling fire in Oculus Home the whole time?

Yesterday I received the package with the Rift S and started the setup. It promped me to update firmware so I updated, then here comes the sensors. [https://i.vgy.me/BxxeTD.png](https://i.vgy.me/BxxeTD.png)

When checking Headset Sensors, it's just stuck. I have tried restarted, nothing worked. I found out that ASMedia controller is a problem, so I tried in different ports. I tried updated the ASmedia drivers, not worked. I have tried disabling ASMedia in BIOS, didn't worked. I bought a extensible card  i-tec PCE22U3. It was the only one to find on local market. Didn't work. Tried changing drivers in Device manager, messing around there. Tried with no other usb connected to the PC. Didn't work. I tried reseating the cables. No luck.

oculus,"Best options for headset, Oculus Rift S","Alright so, I've been getting into VRChat pretty heavy recently, been having a good time. What's not a good time is every time I meet someone new they bitch and moan about my audio quality from the mic, and how it intermittently ""roboticizes"" and is just generally poor quality and makes unpleasant noises on its own accord. This has been ruining my experiences. So, since I'm also looking to supplement the also very poor speakers of the rift S, which honestly at this point are less of a bother than the even poorer mic, I figured the best way to do that is to buy a wireless combo headset. With that said, i tried the ps4 ones that my brother had and they were super loose and did not cup the ears well and wanted to fall off anytime I was playing something active. So, what have people had good luck with. I'm looking for something that foremost, snugly holds the ears and has good audio quality, as well as good mic quality. Now that I think about it, battery life is a big one too. I have been known to play for up to 6-7 hours at a time now that I have gotten my VR legs so it would be nice to not go mute halfway through. I do believe with the rift s the only way to achieve this is wireless since they didn't implement a mic input, so I suppose that's a necessity too.

oculus,CV1 to Quest (PC) first impressions [Technical and experience],"So having just gotten an Oculus Quest after a few months with a dead launch-day OG Rift I'm thrilled to be joining the virtual worlds again, also bare in mind that until my 3m Usb-C cable gets here in a few days I was using a 0.5m cable.

Setup was really easy. On my AMD R9 3900x system which uses an AMD Radeon 5700XT GPU and Gigabyte X570 ITX motherboard there were absolutely no problems whatsoever, it's simply one cable with no dicking about with sensors or the convoluted setup process. I had no issues getting the headset connected and it booted right into Home without any complaints or hickups. Here are the first things I noticed visually...   
   
The **field of view**, it is FAR less boxy and much to my surprise it is noticably **wider** than my OG Rift, I had heard mixed reports of this with some saying the field of view felt narrower, well I can confirm that this isn't the case and I can see more both horizontally and vertically, this is the first thing I noticed and I had tested this by standing on the balcony of my Home and looking out over the mountains (something I did a lot) and immediately it felt like I could both see more, and further - it's a noticable upgrade!   
   
Next were the **colours**, all colors seemed brighter with darker shades being far more uniform and 'black' than on my OG Rift, there were no tints or maura artefacts. Everything felt more alive, I can see any games based in space are going to be a real treat to play on this!   
   
Now onto **resolution**, I was expecting the edges to have that wierd pixelation effect you often see in screenshots from Quest games, I did not see any of this, I looked hard for compression artefacts and could find none (I spent a good hour trying to pick them out, I could not), the resolution is noticably higher than on the OG Rift most likely helped by the higher resolution panels inside the headset, while the screen-door effect is still present if you look for it, it is a big improvement over the OG Rift, I noticed I could see the photos I have imported onto my wall much clearer from further away and could pick out details easily.   

The **lenses** are a big improvement over the OG Rift, there is still some god-rays but they seem far less distracting and the sweet-spot is much bigger, I can look to the edges and still easily read text and pick out details, the lenses seem larger and set further back meaning that someone with glasses will have an easier time using this headset.  

**Tracking** definetly feels 'better', the blind spots are 'static' and relative to me, rather than having to 'guess' where they are due to the placement of the sensors. The controllers worked just fine while waving them around like a muppit and even moving them out of my sightline didn't seem to cause them to drop out.

Finally comfort, I used to find the OG rift not that comfortable after an hour of usage and would get ""Rift face"", I personally actually find the Quest to be more comfortable than the OG Rift here.

tl;dr: It's better in every way than the OG Rift with the added bonus of being able to take it with you and hop into VR on the go",1575492049.0,18,33,196792

oculus,Rift S impressions from a CV1/DK2 user’s perspective,"When the Rift S was announced I admit I was a bit meh about it. The resolution bump and longer cable looked nice, but losing OLED and the rather nice audio solution of the CV1 just didn’t seem worth it. But then of course Black Friday took £50 off the price and it seemed like the right time to dive in and see how it is.

First impressions out of the box were mixed. The headset itself definitely feels high quality. The materials used are very good, especially the plush cushion on the inside of the halo. It just seemed a bit bulky compared to the CV1 thanks to the halo. I expected it to be much heavier than it was when I lifted it out of the box. Likewise the new controllers are a big improvement in materials, they feel fantastic in your hand.

The setup experience was a bit of a pain for no reason I could see. The mandatory headset firmware upgrade seemed like it had stuck and spent a worrying amount of time just sitting there doing not very much. There definitely needs to be better feedback to the user while that’s going on. And then I got the dreaded sensors can’t track error. Unplugging and replugging the USB cable as suggested had no effect, but a quick reboot seemed to do the trick.

Popping the headset on for the first time I was hugely surprised at just how comfortable and easy to secure it is. There’s no pressure on your face at all, the weight seems perfectly evenly distributed by the halo. Once secured it doesn’t wiggle or move about.

&amp;nbsp;

As soon as the screens activated the improvements over the CV1 display were evident. I was hugely sceptical of the claims of vastly reduced/no screen door but it’s absolutely true. If anything it feels like a bigger leap than going from DK2 to CV1 did. I had to keep my head absolutely still and really hunt for signs of pixels. It’s a huge improvement because everything looks and feels far more solid and much less like you’re looking through a mesh at a screen. God rays are indeed hugely reduced or eliminated. I noticed some shimmer around white text on a black background on a Wolves in the Walls loading screen, but nothing anywhere else.

Text on the Oculus UI is crystal clear, and Virtual Desktop is a joy. The ‘sweet spot’ is definitely far bigger and you can really look around with your eyes to see stuff clearly without having to move your head to get things legible. Watching videos with the reduced screen door and better pixel density  is a far more enjoyable experience, whether in Virtual Desktop, Big Screen or 3D SBS/180 content.

Firing up Elite Dangerous and DCS it was clear that legibility of text and instruments is vastly better, Especially in DCS. The inky not-quite-black of space (I never messed with SPUD) is still there but it looks significantly smoother with less obvious blocky gradients. Colours are great, contrast is not noticeably any worse than CV1 and it all looks superb. I haven’t noticed any detriment to the step down to 80hz refresh rate.

&amp;nbsp;

Which was when I realised that the tracking was just working perfectly. I’d not really thought about it, but the inside-out tracking does indeed work as advertised. In the few hours I’ve spent in the headset I’ve had no issues at all, even in a poorly lit room with a flashing Christmas tree at the other end. If I hadn’t known better I’d not have been able to tell it apart from the CV1 tracking set up, except now I have more bits of my room I can use as I can go in part of the room that I couldn’t cover with sensors before.

&amp;nbsp;

So audio. This surprised me. It’s actually really nice not to have anything on your ears and the sound is really not bad. It’s not great, but it’s spacious and very natural, even if it does lack bass. Sadly I’ll rarely get to use it that way as my PC is in the living/dining room and even on CV1 I was always getting told to turn it down. And that’s where the headphone jack really shines, because I can finally fully isolate the outside world from my VR audio. What I haven’t settled on is which headphones are best to use. My ATH-M50x headset fits over the halo, just, but it all gets a bit painful if I want to just slip the headset off quickly. Some AKG in-ear buds worked much better in practical terms, but at the cost of losing the spacious nature of the sound. In the end I’m a bit torn on this and I’m not sure if I’d rather have the CV1 audio solution back or not.

&amp;nbsp;

The other big addition which I was a bit meh about initially was pass through. It just didn’t seem to offer that much practical value. Until I realised that it automatically activates if you put your head through the guardian boundary. And that is really cool. It is quite handy to be able to double-click the oculus button and activate to check where you are without having to try and squint through the reduced (but not eliminated) nose gap.

That Oculus button on the right remote though. That needs a rethink. I know I’ll get used to it but I must have accidentally hit it at least five or six times and it’s just a nuisance.

&amp;nbsp;

So how do I feel about it overall? I think it’s pretty great. The downsides aren’t nearly as down as they might seem on  paper, and the improvements in the screen and lenses over the CV1 are spectacular. Virtual worlds now feel far more solid and substantial, and the extra comfort of the halo design means I can spend much longer enjoying them.

Every game I've tried so far from Steamvr starts up and works fine. But anytime I start up Superhot VR or FORM (a cheap but nice puzzle game), they get stuck on the loading tile. Nothing ever happens. Somehow I figured out that they load up only if I first unplug my monitor (HDMI to TV in this case). I've tried everything else I can think of.. switching ports, running the HDMI to DVI adapter, but no luck. Have any of you ran across this issue? It's super annoying having to unplug my TV everytime I wanna play those 2 games. Am I missing a setting somewhere?

oculus,"""Headset Sensor Tracking"" stuck for my new Oculus Rift S, haven't heard back from Oculus support and hoping you guys have other ideas on how I can fix this problem so I don't have to return my headset","**""Headset Sensor Tracking""** is the problem spot I can't get past.

So I unboxed it Sunday and had some difficulty getting started. Oculus software installed just fine, so I started the setup. I thought I had to have everything plugged in before I got there, so after it wouldn't connect I disconnected, restarted and tried again. After quite some time, the setup finally got past ""Headset Sensor Tracking"" and I was able to hook up the touch controllers and play.

It wasn't perfect, but it worked for a few hours Sunday night. I did the tutorial with the robot in the trailer, played around in Home, then figured out how to play Elite Dangerous. I didn't know you could hold down the Oculus button to reset the look in front of you, so I messed around with redrawing the guardian boundary so I could sit in my desk chair and play with it in front of me (knowing about the buttons now makes that 20 minutes of futzing with the boundary funny). Played it for about 20 minutes before bed (it took me several hours to get it going) and stopped.

The next day, I couldn't get it to read. I've got [my logs through last night here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1K-tI-jjVi4OKT8785p1TV4Fc3mvdL8UQ/view?usp=sharing), and it looks like the USB port isn't reading the headset. So I tried a number of things:

* *Change Advanced Power Settings*: **Disabled** USB selective suspend setting
* *Device Manager &gt; USB Controllers &gt; R-Click* ‘**Rift S USB Hub**’ and unchecked  ‘Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power’
* *Tried every USB port:* I have tried plugging the USB into every port I have on the machine, including the 2.0 slots. Every time, I unplug the Display Port cable and plug it back in 10-20 seconds after plugging in the USB.
* *Tried plugging in minimal other cables*: I read that it may not draw enough power if other stuff is plugged in with it. Didn't work when it was only cable plugged in any of the 6 USB ports.
* *Tried reseating the headset cable*: it was plugged in strongly before, but I reseated the cable and made sure to be careful plugging it back in.
* *Updated Windows 10*: No change
* *Updated drivers for GPU, MoBo, CPU:* No change
* *Uninstalled and reinstalled Oculus software*: No change

I have tried some other things, but they aren't coming to mind right now as I sit at work. I did order [this PCIe card](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00B6ZCNGM/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) on Monday night, but that isn't going to arrive at my house until Friday. Judging by the log, I'm guessing it's got to be that the USB ports on my MoBo aren't getting enough power to the headset, but the *audio* works perfectly fine - I've left the headset plugged in after trying to connect, and then played some Final Fantasy XI only to hear the audio coming from the headset.

If anyone has any ideas, I'll include my PCPartPicker parts list to show all the stuff in it.

If anyone has a solution I don't know about, I'm all ears, nothing I've found has helped so far.

I just purchased an Oculus Rift S over black friday and have been having a few issues, mainly when trying to pair the Oculus touch controllers. Everything works up until ""Pairing Left Controller"". Pressing menu + Y takes way longer than it should to make the light blink. It tries for 30 seconds or so before saying ""unable to pair"". It then disconnects the headset via USB 3 cable (though the cable itself stays connected) and the controller flashes fast in an S.O.S. style for minutes afterward. The headset cannot find the controller afterwards.

I have attempted disconnecting all other USB devices, running the driver through the support tab (which fixed another issue I had), and reconnecting both cables as the controller pairs. I have double checked the batteries as well.

Some things to note: Yesterday the headset made a quiet hissing/coil whine noise, which has since stopped (I read that was normal until guardian was set up but I haven't gotten that far). The headset light has gone from white to yellow a few times but it fixes itself immediately.",1575479737.0,6,6,196792
oculus,Brass Tactics and The Unspoken are freakin amazing!,"So, after 6 months absolutely loving my Quest, and drooling over the expansive library of PCVR games, I finally just got a pc to use with a Link. There have been a few games particularly that I’ve had my eye on which really helped push me over the edge on buying the PC.

Now, finally, after months of watching gameplay videos and reviews I finally have them (well almost all of them) and let me just say I am not disappointed!

Brass Tactics is just the most accessible, intuitive and downright fun game, such a refreshing change of pace from all the pew pew. Don’t get me wrong, I love a good shooter, but I like to have a diverse library that covers a bunch of different gaming moods, and this fills a massive hole in my VR experience. If you’re on the fence on this one then I strongly recommend you try the free “Arena” version. 

The Unspoken is similar, in that it offers something different from a lot of other games, and what it offers is an absolute blast! Admittedly, I’ve only just got it and played through about an hour of the story mode, so I can’t comment on AI opponents or multiplayer, but what I’ve played so far has made me grin from ear to ear. I can’t wait to unlock all the different character classes, skill up and head into battle. So much fun!

Next on my list is In Death and Arizona Sunshine, but I want to take my time with these two before I jump to the next ones.

For all the new to PCVR people out there, what are the games that are blowing your minds? And to all the veterans, what are the games that you think the noobs should be rushing to get?",1575451782.0,31,32,196792
oculus,Is PCVR worth the jump.,I had no experience with VR until 2 weeks ago I bought myself a oculus quest. I love it since buying I have not touched my PS4 pro or Xbox One X I have just played my quest. I only have 3 real gripes with my quest one is the graphics. Although they are not terrible I want the most visually stunning VR experience. However in order to get that I would need to invest in a valve index rift s or vice pro. My second complaint is a lot of the VR seem like 1-3 hour experiences and I come from playing 50 hour open world campaign style games. Lastly is the game library although it has options it’s limited compared to the options I would have on PC. I have been considering building a PC for a while and now I’m thinking this might be the time with VR. However my question is for anyone that has PCVR is it a groundbreaking experience coming from a quest? My only fear is I spend 4-6k in building a gaming PC monitors desk chair upgrading my VR system and it’s just only a slight or not a huge 1000s of dollar better upgrade. I understand value is subjective because we all make different money. I am fortunate enough where I can afford to upgrade and spend the 4-6k for everything but I only want to do it if it’s truly worth it. I understand so much of this is subjective but I would really appreciate if anyone has any experience that could compare or give any advice I really do appreciate it.,1575516860.0,1,31,196792

With the various patches to NMS VR, a lot of the ideas put forward in older guides soon after the VR release aren't as applicable. I don't have the technical knowledge to tell you what kinds of little things you can try to squeeze the most juice out of your computer when playing NMS VR, but I did do a bunch of experimenting and determined what graphical settings should be prioritised for the best aesthetic, immersive experience imHo.

This guide is only effective for computers above a certain threshhold of power. Mine is an RTX 2070.

The short of it: prioritise super sampling over in-game graphical setting improvements. To a point. 

The in-game settings I will provide are based off testing where I feel these settings provide the most impact for the least resources. Further increases don't create substantial aesthetic benefit, but further downgrades result in pretty big negative aesthetic result. The guide starts with these settings, no more, no less, follow them exactly (if your computer can't run these settings at regular 1x resolution then I would ignore this guide T_T):

**Texture Quality**: High

**Animation Quality**: Ultra (depends on your CPU, because this setting uses CPU only)

**Shadow Quality**: Enhanced

**Post Processing**: High

**Volumetric Effects**: Standard

**Terrain Tesselation**: Standard (off)

**Planet Quality**: Standard

**Base Qaulity**: ...I haven't spent time around bases yet, so I'm not sure. I have it set to High for now.

**Anisotropic Filtering**: 2

**Anti Aliasing**: Off/none

**GBAO**: Off

Okay, in-game settings done.

**Go to Steam VR settings. Check the box to disable ASW (in the ""Applications"" tab).**

**After that, also in the Applications tab, just adjust your Super sampling as high as you can without losing that solid framerate (you want your game staying in the green of that little live display of your refresh rate).** If you can go higher than 200%, I'd stop there and start bumping graphics settings again.

But damn, 200% is beautiful. I can't run it at 80fps with 2x on my setup, but I tried it for a bit just to see and it's gorgeous. The super sampling makes a much bigger difference in NMS than any of those graphical settings past what I listed, imo.

On my system if I want to achieve 80fps I have to stick closer to 100% resolution. :'( I'm in the process of deciding whether I'd rather run smooth at 80fps or keep the super sampling nice and high and suffer the consequences...

If your computer can't handle those baseline in-game graphic settings, I would lower the graphics settings before lowering resolution below 100%. Shit gets rough. A big part of No Man's Sky is that beauty, and at some point that gets lost amidst the noise when the resolution isn't high enough.

If you do reach 200% at a comfortable, stable fps, imo the first thing you would want to increase after that is Anisotropic filtering. Anywhere up to and including the max 16. before prioritising something else. This will get everything just a little crisper and more detailed from a distance, which again I feel is one of the more impactful aesthetic changes you can make in NMS VR. Turning on something like Terrain Tesselation or GBAO is nice, but rather than being an aesthetic improvement, I feel that it's more of an aesthetic DIFFERENCE. So unless you're REALLY attached to the look of one of those, you don't really lose anything turning them off, and I wouldn't prioritise them (they seem to take up a lot of resources I think).

Hope that helps some people enjoy it!",1575430399.0,42,21,196792

For some reason it doesn't influence Oculus home that much, but when you run a game, even natively like Space Pirate Trainer or Catan VR you can notice it.

oculus,Rift S review after 6 months,"I purchased my first VR headset (Rift S) this summer and it has mostly been a blast. I've introduced family members and friends to VR, which has probably been the best part of the experience for me. Watching them pop into First Steps/Contact and Beat Saber for the first time has probably been one of the best gaming experiences of my life. I've finally been able to bond over games with the people in my life who don't normally play games at all. My girlfriend and I have put in a ton of hours on Beat Saber, the game is great and the mod community makes it amazing. Normally I have no interest in rhythm games but this one has definitely been the exception. I've also had a bit of fun with the archery range in The Lab, Superhot VR, and the lightsaber dojo in Vader Immortal.

All those nice things said, I really wish I could get more out of my VR experience and play some more intense games. Sadly, every time I've tried I've ended up regretting it. I've attempted a number of others (mostly Lone Echo, Pavlov VR, Onward, Blade &amp; Sorcery). I've got plenty of others in my library to try as well since I purchased the summer sale game packs on both the Oculus store and on Steam.

What's preventing me from wanting to even try is motion sickness (or virtual reality sickness, which I suppose is more accurately the lack of motion, confusing the brain). I've tried a lot of advice mentioned here. Marijuana, ginger tea, frequent breaks, slowly working my way up and trying to build a resistance. I'm always done by my first break. I start feeling it as soon as I load into these games. My IPD is slightly above the recommendation for the Rift S (69) but I don't think that's too impactful. And it's not just me, everyone whom I've had test my headset while playing a game with movement/""moderate comfort"" level has reported the same feelings of dizziness and nausea. This really makes me wonder what people are talking about on the sub when they claim to have overcome these problems, or never had them to begin with. I've only extensively tested it on myself, but I've yet to meet anyone who doesn't experience nausea or claim it doesn't bother them.

Because of this, I've preferred to stick to my 2D world of gaming and declare my VR headset a $400 Beat Saber machine, and nifty toy for social gatherings. While I did really enjoy my short play sessions of other games in the moment, it's just not worth the horrible regret afterward.",1575447057.0,11,56,196792

My quest arrived last night and I'm pretty impressed. Tried a couple of native demos and it reminds me of WII games. In a good way, that the sheer fun and immersion makes me forget the simple cartoony graphics. Why waste money on graphics cards when its this good.

Oh yeah.

I want to play PC games. So, after a bit of messing about I finally managed to get the only VR PC game I own running. Dirt Rally 2.0.

But knowing the Quest was coming I bought Elite in the Steam sale (I already have it on Commodore 64, Atari ST and PS4!). When looking into how to get Dirt Rally running (I thought that as it has an Oculus mode I just selected that) I found a lot of complaints about the steam version not supporting Oculus API and wonder if this is a real issue.

Should I refund Steam Elite while I can and pay 4x the price for the Oculus version? What about future games? Should I buy from the Oculus store where possible?

Do other games on Steam support Oculus natively? I did try launching a VR benchmark app from Steam before I knew I had to install SteamVR and it just worked.",1575469044.0,2,4,196792

Also the laptop has lower res on the screen u at  1920×1080 but that should not impact the visuals on the headset as far as I know. I also noticed that everythin looked smaller and lower down in beatsaber with the laptop. The boxes were smaller and closer to the ground.

An interesting thing is that if I'm not the headset and am playing sound through the speakers it sounds fine, but when I put it on some contact must get disconnected or something because it just craps out again.

oculus,PSA: Why You probably SHOULDN'T buy a used CV1 off eBay,"So we all know about the CV1 cable kerfuffle, being on this subreddit it's impossible to miss because there are almost daily threads complaining about it. That isn't what this post is about, but for those who are living under a tin foil covered rock Oculus has stopped making the HDMI/USB cable that connects the headset to your PC, meaning you're stuck paying $120+ on eBay if yours happens to break.

Recently, I've noticed CV1s are going stupid cheap on eBay, like $150-200 cheap, and on the surface it seems like a great value. The CV1 has excellent tracking, great controllers, and at that price it seems like an absolute bargain, and if you're mindful about the cable you should be able to stretch it to a year or so and hopefully by that point there will be some kind of solution to the cable issue or other replacement VR hardware would be available or cheaper. No, the issue is with the actual headset condition itself.

The reason for the price drop is pretty simple: old Rift users are nervous about the state of the platform, and are trying to sell off their current hardware to help fund an upgrade to a Rift S or Index. This alone isn't an issue, thats just how markets work, but what *is* an issue is the large number of users misrepresenting their heavily used headset's condition trying to play off consumer ignorance. My friend just fell for one of these, and purchased a set that was described as in ""very good condition"" and that there was ""nothing wrong with it"". Then he got it and immediately asked if the headset [cable was supposed to look like this](https://i.imgur.com/W1eWGtU.jpg). Honest to god this thing has one of the worst cables I've seen, [and it's a small wonder it still works](https://i.imgur.com/s0omLs3.jpg). The shielding is crinkled and bent due to constant prolonged twisting, and is flat out broken in a couple of places where there are tight knots. I'm pretty sure if you remove the knot the cable will just fail. It's quite obvious that the seller knew this thing was nearing its end and passed it off while it still somewhat worked.

Just taking a quick look and there are more issues that can be pretty hard to spot in listings that I've rarely seen disclosed, such as scratched lenses, broken audio ribbon cables, cracked controllers (I've seen some clever camera angles), and missing sensor stands. I'm not saying all of them are bad, and I bet a lot are in great shape (some people on this sub have had good luck I know), but it's really hard to spot ones that are bad and there is a significant chance you get ""one of the bad ones"".

The thing with this is, eBay takes their post descriptions rather seriously (otherwise literally nobody would shop there), and is *incredibly* buyer-biased when dealing with issues like this. If eBay feels that the seller was being misleading in a small way, they usually side with the buyer (this is why you want to avoid sweeping claims like ""nothing wrong with it"" in your description when selling less than perfect items, as it pretty much always will bite you in the ass). Chances are he can get this sorted through eBay's support team, and if not he's just out the money he paid for the thing unless he wants to pay another $150 for the cable, as I doubt this thing will last more than a week of daily use.

So if you want to buy one just get one with the most detailed description, right? Well, that is a strategy, and will give you some help when going through ebay's buyer protection system, but honestly imo it's not worth it just so you don't have to go through the hassle of dealing with eBay scammers. If you are considering one, you can request more pictures of the lenses, accessories, and cable in the advert, which will help you not end up in this situation, although some photos (esp of lenses) won't be all that helpful.

If you're serious about wanting a Rift CV1 (I won't stop you, it's a great HMD), here are my tips. First, shop local on CL and FB Market. Then you can actually have a look and test what you're buying before dropping the money. If the seller is hesitant to let you do a test run with their computer equipment, then just walk. I seriously saw an ad from someone pretending that their computer didn't work with it and thats why they can't show you it works. Secondly, don't actually believe the sellers ""only used it for a week"" claims. Literally every single eBay and local ad I've seen always mentions how little they used it, and I wouldn't believe any of it. Finally, if you're still wanting to buy on eBay for the better buyer protection or due to a lack of local options, refer to the paragraph above and get as much info as possible before dropping the cash. You don't want to end up getting a damaged headset.

&amp;#x200B;

So yea, Tl;Dr there right now is a rush to get rid of CV1 hardware due to both its age and fear about the viability of it in the future, and this is leading to several worn out/partially damaged examples being sold as fully working units by people looking to get out. All it takes is to be an informed buyer, and remember to not settle for damaged hardware when you don't have to, but know you might have to if you are unlucky. Shopping local will probably be cheaper and give you a better result. 

Finally, if you are planning to sell your CV1, be as honest about it as possible and price it accordingly. I know it sucks that in a year your headset lost over 50% of its value, but misleading people like this hurts the growth of VR overall and especially on eBay there is a high chance it doesn't end well for you.

I also tried edit my graphics settings and turn down resolutions, still no luck but games do run smoother. I have 3 USB 3.0 ports that only my front USB 3.0 only seems to accept it, while the other seem to not want to work.

I do stream as well so the upgrade would be needed anyway but any help would be appreciated. :)

Also my audio on the headset never works and when I do get it working it will cause the rest of the unit to shutdown. Is that possibly the issue that could cause it. I initially had the sound issue first too so I think its a big issue.",1575444181.0,2,6,196792

Just earlier I was trying to look for something, lifted my headset up a bit and the lines came back, but they stayed, I was wondering if it was the cable so I moved it around a bit but it stayed like that. Closing the game + steamvr didnt fix it, but restarting Oculus is what reverted it back to normal. Also the bottom of the view was like a pond of light the lines went into, idk. The white Light to indicate if there someone wearing the headset is also constantly on when this happens and wont go orange.

Im not sure if its noteworthy but the left side of my headset isnt really pulling the strap back in anymore, Idk if it was like that from the start.

Obviously this isnt something I really want happening to my headset just because i lift it up a bit to check for something irl.

made sure headset is plugged into a USB 3.0 port

I don’t 100% know if it’s a side effect of VRing or not.

oculus,Oculus Rift S Controllers Cause Headset Blackout. Assistance Would Be Greatly Appreciated!,"Good afternoon Reddit, I'm coming to you today for an interesting technical problem occurring with hopes that someone here may have encountered the same, and even more hopeful that someone may have a fix. I have submitted a ticket and chatted with three different support specialists who were all very helpful, however all of them stated that they had never heard of this before. From reading the many troubleshooting posts throughout the web I was very well prepared to work with support and had tried everything that they asked me to prior to contacting them. Below are the troubleshooting methods I attempted:

* Disabled power saving mode shutting off USBs
* Ensured all USB ports did not shut down for power via the device manager
* Re-seated the headset cable ensuring all pins were in tact, as well as unplugging re-plugging Display and USB
* Updated all drivers (graphics, device
* Re download and reinstall, with firewalls and AV disabled
* Repair tool
* 100% clean windows installation, discarding all files
* Switch between all available display ports and USB ports
* Other things that I cant recall as I worked on the issue for approximately 10 hours last night.

Listed below are the specs of my hardware and applicable software:

* MSI Z170 gaming MOBO
* EVGA GTX 1080 FTW
* I7 6700k
* 32 GB RAM
* 120 GB SSD (OS), 240 GB SSD, 1TB SSD
* 650w PSU (not sure if that might be the issue as its fairly low)
* Windows 10 Build 19033.1 (unable to revert to earlier build, or do not have the know how)

To further explain the issue, essentially what is happening is the Oculus Rift S headset when put on will emit a low white light then flicker to black. I then have to take it off and place it back on to replicate the issue. Somehow after hours of testing I found that if I take the batteries out of the controllers the setup menu and the room around me (via onboard cameras) is visible. As soon as I put one battery into the controller the screen goes black. This disallows me from actually going through the setup tutorial. When scanning the event logs the only thing that I can find is this error; "" Oculusdash.exe"" error. I cannot seem to find any other posts or information about this issue and support specialists stated that they have never seen this before. Again, any help with this would be greatly appreciated as this is my first potential VR experience. I just received the box yesterday and I am excited to join you all in the Oculus world. Thanks,

I ended up getting an a USB C Display-port Adapter and giving it a try anyways because the USB C port shows the DP logo next to it. Plugged everything in and IT WORKS, although with a little stutter. If I minimize the screen mirroring on the desktop the stutter isn't as bad. 

What my question is, is the Rift S running off of my RTX 2060 on the system, or is the CPU discreet graphics somehow rendering things?

oculus,Rift S with External Sensors,"Listen, I know this post is going to face immediate criticism and I know I’m going to get people commenting saying “it’s never going to happen, just deal with it”, but just please let me dream... 

I posted something similar around June and wanted to bring it back up because nothing more has been said about it. Look, the Rift S sensors are pretty dang good, but not perfect. They really struggle for me in FPS games where I’m covering up one hand sometimes and in games like Arena and even BeatSaber My hand will spas out at the end of a swing (I think I’m swinging too hard lol). We talked about this issue early in the Rift S release but heard little back from Oculus when we asked “would it be possible to ever use Rift CV1 sensors in conjunction with the Rift S headset”. But we did get one answer. “It is possible”. An answer to give us hope and shut us up for awhile. 

Here we are months and months later watching the quest get upgrade after upgrade to its software capabilities and we are left with the same ol’ headsets we bought at launch. People have been quoted saying “I’d be much more comfortable upgrading to the Rift S if I could keep using my sensors”. Look, Oculus, people are not sold on your product because it’s getting no love. Give us something. At least give me another “it’s possible” to give me hope for a few more months. 

-Sincerely, A hopeless Rift S Owner

I just got a very sweet laptop I am in love with (Asus ROG  GX531GX-XB76 )

Unlike cheaper models of the same laptop, it does not have a Thunderbolt port, only a USB type c gen2 connected to the GPU (Display Port Ready)

Tonight I tried to fire up the Oculus Rift S and...well, though I bought the exact adapter that was recommended to me by TyrielWood's video, the Display Port isn't finding anything connected.

&amp;#x200B;

A little more research, and I am being told it's because it's not a Thunderbolt port.

WUT? Why is this important? I'm baffled why a more expensive and higher spoecced laptop would have a USB type c Display Port connected to a GPU that is not Thunderbotl, thus rendering it completely incompatible with Rift S. Is this really the case?

I'm kind of devastated (This thing wasn't cheap and I do love it) and I know the Quest could work, but I am concerned with the heavier headset, the latency, and the lower refresh rate on the Quest using link.

oculus,What is UP with the Oculus PC Client team?!,"So, probably will get down voted or not even seen for this, but I must rant.

I decided to take the task upon me off reconnecting my rift (cv1) in my new home.

Took 30-40 minutes to setup 3 sensors, since they have a specific combination of usb ports that they only works on.

Then, tried to install a new game. Well... oculus has this fun new message that says ""We think your antivirus is not letting us install the game"" to which, of course, the answer is ""I do not have any anti virus installed"". Well, the internet says, ""Whats the problem! Just download the oculus installation program and click 'Repair'! Whats the big deal!""

And so, 7.5 GB later, the screen finally changes, and now it says ""Well, that it didn't work for some reason we cant explain - go to our support page. Oh also, we already uninstalled your semi-working copy of the oculus app (that wasnt in the message it just FING HAPPENED)""

And... the cherry - oculus had this issue long back when it was only starting where you could only install its client on your C drive. Just some silliness that was cleared back in... never. Yup, oculus now needs more than 10GB (about 21 including the installation files it also insists on downloading to the C drive) and still THEY DEMAND YOU INSTALL IT IN YOUR C DRIVE. Hey, oculus, ever hear about how people buy small SSD drives to install windows on? 

They make it appear on their support site there is a way around this, but, you guessed it, there isnt. Because although you can pass them a ""drive"" argument, it only applies to the games you will download later, which you can ALREADY CHANGE FROM THE FING SETTINGS MENU ANYWAYS.

I hope one guy in charge of the PC client team sees this, and that I wasted at least a fraction of the time of his, as he did to me. How can a company be so far on the edge of technology, and so far back at the same time.

3 hours in, and I'm still looking at the download page of the installer... 4/7.5GB.

I got my Rift S yesterday, replacing my CV1. The CV1 used to fit my face perfect and was great, but the Rift S seems to drift, tilting down after minutes of play, skewing the image slightly. 

I’ve come to find out that it’s because I have weak ass cheekbones, and it doesn’t make contact with both above and below my eyes on my face, just above when in its optimal angle. This also introduces wobble to the entire display when moving. Tightening the straps / ratchet on the back only tighten the contact between my forehead and the back of my head, which only adds discomfort after a certain point and in no way solves my problem.

The USBs and Touch controllers work great, but the HDMI won't detect for some reason. I've tried everything everyone has said to do on the forums. Ensuring the cable is fully plugged in, unplugging and replugging, updating my drivers, reinstalling the software. No luck. 

     I'll explain more in depth. If I plug in the HDMI first, nothing happens; no lights, no nothing. If I plug in the connected USB first, I get one green check and a red light turns on in my headset. Then when I plug in the HDMI, the red light changes to either white or blue (I'm a bit colorblind), images go through my headset, and I can hear sound out of both headphones. For some reason I see the skyrim main screen. However, the HDMI still isn't recognized. I continue to setup my sensors but it doesn't change anything, the Oculus still says the HDMI is undetected.

oculus,"Sex, Censorship, and Ethics in VR","Can Oculus ban you for watching porn?

The Oculus Code of Conduct says, ""*Do not: Use or promote sexually explicit content or conduct yourself in a sexually obscene or abusive way.*"" *""For repeated or egregious offenses, we may permanently disable your account.""*

Among consenting adults, sexual media, communication, and behavior is normal and healthy and is not equatable with abuse. Sexual expression is among the first uses of any communication technology from cave paintings to video chat. (*Rule 34 of the internet: If it exists, or can be imagined, there is internet porn of it.*) Furthermore, VR/AR promises to be a general purpose computing and collaboration technology. I can understand the desire to create safe spaces for certain audiences, and the desire to prevent abuse of all kinds, but the platform-wide banning of sex seems like a Black Mirror plot twist leading to a dystopic future.

It creates a ""suspected terrorist"" or ""drug war"" situation in which the vast majority of users knowingly break the code of conduct (which can be interpreted as a legal contract for many purposes) and are subject to de-platforming and exclusion for unstated reasons and zero legal recourse. Where purchased hardware can become ""bricked"" at the whim of the manufacturer. Censoring adult app developers from the Oculus Store prevents them from economically participating with a large audience of willing customers, and disincentivizes creative investment in the genre.

This topic also ties into the broader topic of private companies controlling public discourse without the public having recourse to amend these often secret and politically/socially motivated policies. Not to mention the idea that in the near future (or present?) black box AI algorithms may be controlling public discourse for motivations of their own without human oversight thus allowing our culture to be molded by powerful influence technologies with no broader understanding or appreciation of consequences.",1575416629.0,0,17,196792

A friend did a solution with a small wireless keyboard he had in his pocket to have access to text commands and special key binds. That works fine he says but me liking to take the harder and more complicated way thought I could have a USB Hub between the headset and battery. At first it seemed to work as I could attach other USB devices that could control my PC (keyboard) but unfortunately my headset didn't work anymore until I removed the hub again.

I'm not very experienced when it comes to hardware so I'm asking here first: Would it be possible to run the OpenTPCast OS on a different system besides the TPCast module?
For example; Raspberry Pi is a Linux single board PC with integrated wireless card, four USBs and one HDMI port. I'm pretty sure the native TPCast module is stronger compared to the Pi, but a different mother board such as the Mini-ITX with additional cards and ports on it can be used too. I haven't tried it yet as I don't have a spare Micro-USB right now to use in my Raspberry Pi 3, but if you guys think it's, possible next time I walk into my town's computer store I might buy one with the intent of flashing OpenTPCast to it.",1575381506.0,2,0,196792

oculus,Rift S is a definite upgrade over the CV1,"With the current holiday VR deals, I decided to rid myself of the Oculus sensors once and for all. I brought home a shiny new Rift S. Most reviews mentioned this as being the primary reason to ""upgrade"", but were hesitant to really call the Rift S a proper successor. Well, after 4 hours with the headset, I'd say this is very clearly better than my CV1. It's like experiencing VR again for the first time.

**Note:** The Rift S has very distinct physical limitations not found in the CV1/Quest related to the lack of physical IPD adjustments. The Rift S presents no upgrade worth suffering if you are outside of the supported range.

**Specs Don't Lie, They Just Don't Tell the Whole Truth**

The Rift S has deceptively bad specs. Slightly higher resolution but a drop in refresh rate and panel quality. You'd be forgiven if you mistook the Rift S as a new budget model. Yes, it has inside-out tracking, and yes it has a more comfortable mount, but both of those things can be solved by us, the consumer, with a little more money and elbow grease. Yet, there exists another thing that we cannot fix that desperately needs to be: The Lenses

**The Spotlight is Gone**

The biggest problem with the CV1 has got to be the Godrays. They destroy clarity, image quality, and immersion. Like a bright shining beacon hiding behind every object that comes your way, the godrays created by the CV1 lenses cheapened the entire experience. On the Rift S they are greatly reduced to the point of being a graphical feature rather than distortion.

If I had to rate the intensity of the Godrays from 1-10, the CV1 would be a 7 and the Rift S a 3. I'm sure it can get even better, but I feel like we're at the threshold where it's ""good enough"".

**Is it Hot in Here?**

Speaking of image clarity, no one mentions the CV1 being prone to getting fogged up. I guess because it's just a problem in the first 10 minutes of play, but I can't tell you how many times I've had to readjust my headset to stop my breath from fogging up the lenses. Even the moisture from your eyes is enough to get it misty. Has not happened with the Rift S yet. I put it on and it's good right from the start.

**Replacing the Screen Door**

While OLED is superior in black level and color vividness, LCD has the benefit of being brighter with better pixel arrangement. That means that you're seeing less dot pitch and more of a seamless image. In the CV1 I was able to see the space between pixels very easily, but the Rift S does a much better job of hiding this. There are times when the SDE just.. disappears.

**Playing More Makes Sense**

There is nothing inherently wrong with the sensor system on the CV1. What inside-out tracking provides is ease of scalability. Everyone knows that if you're playing in multiple rooms or using a VR capable laptop the Rift S is a huge benefit, but not many people mention how awesome it is for going from room-scale to sitting at a desk. Or laying in bed. Or just facing an entirely different direction from where your computer is.

I don't have a dedicated space to play VR so this appeals to me on an entirely different level than someone who does. I need to make the best out of my available space as soon as it comes up. That might mean playing Vader Immortal in my desk chair or beat saber in the space by the door. I couldn't before. Now I can.

**Being Alone With Your Thoughts is Scary**

Some people love being fully immersed and closed off from the real world when they play in VR. That's scary to me. I'm always conscious of someone walking up to me or needing my attention. I know the Guardian system is there, but since I do move around I end up turning that off. For that reason I usually don't fully place the headphones or often peek through the little space above my nose. The Rift S solves this problem completely by allowing me to see through the cameras.

I can align with reality while being in virtual reality.

**Not Quite Refreshed**

So why bother with the CV1 if you can get the Rift S? 90hz screens. I'll always reiterate that playing VR is better than no VR, and if 90hz makes you feel a bit queazy, 80hz can likely make you feel super queazy. There is a difference, and I would be weary of getting feedback from anyone that says otherwise.

I've adapted to playing VR so I don't feel motion sick, but I can appreciate the difference in refresh rate. It's not a deal breaker for me by any means, but it's there. One of those aspects that you can clearly see the next version improving.

**The Quest for the Right Headset**

So I fully believe the Rift S is a full and complete upgrade from the CV1, but does that mean it's the only upgrade? Not by a long shot. I plan on trying out a Quest in the near future and seeing if the Rift S holds up. Just like there are things that the Rift S provides above and beyond a spec sheet, the Quest provides a feature you can't find elsewhere for the same cost: Untethered gameplay. Lots of us would give up a bit of graphical clarity for an entirely new experience all together. The question is whether I would, and I'm dying to find out.

I hope I was able to help any of you who were on the fence just like me. It sucks to know that we spent over $700 for the CV1 experience only for it to be replaced by a $350 bundle, but I think the Rift S is worth the money. There's a big hurdle with improving resolution in future headsets and it's not just the headset itself but also the computer. Ask yourself if you plan on spending another $600-800 in the near future for a graphics card upgrade. If the answer is no, then Rift S or Quest Link might be the best you can handle. If the answer is yes, then you need to ask yourself how long you are willing to wait before the next headset.",1575333535.0,20,32,196792

oculus,1 Day in VR: My Experience,"I purchased a rift S after years of wanting to be apart of the VR world, and it is incredible. So far I’d say I’ve spend about 4ish hours between a few games...mainly super hot and Arizona sunshine. 

Outside a few crashes, everything has worked fairly easily. I haven’t quite figured out navigating VR outside of games. Oculus and steam each have their own “home,” and neither seem to have all my games in one place. To view my VIVEPORT games I have to open vive up and it essentially shows just like my desktop. That has been less than ideal, but honestly I think is more due to me not knowing how to use the software then the software itself. Any guidance would be helpful! 

The Rift S itself has been amazing. Extremely easy setup, great display, comfortable fit. The sound, of course, is just okay and can be improved with earbuds or a headset. So far I’ve honestly been okay with the built in headphones, but everything just sounds okay. The tracking of my body and head movement as well as hands is very good. I have a fairly small play area to work with, it meets the minimum recommendation, but still nothing impressive. I’ve hit the wall a couple times( sorry neighbor,) but generally the guardian does a good job at telling me where I am. I turned it up a bit to given me more of a warning with my small area. 

Motion sickness has been iffy. Any game where I start to feel sick I have put off for now. After playing superhot or Arizona sunshine for an hour or so I will feel the need to take off my headset. It’s a very slight uncomfort, and something that I think time will fix. Games with sliding are rough right now, and have avoided as such. Teleporting isn’t ideal for me gameplay wise, but it does a MUCH better job at keeping your head ok. 

Overall, very impressed with the technology and can’t wait to experience more. I know I have just touched the tip of the iceberg. 

This has been a quick and not planned out description of what my experience has been so far, but I hope it helps someone looking into VR. Ask me questions or give me suggestions if you have any!",1575325597.0,29,41,196792

oculus,"I was wrong, SO very wrong!, I'm sorry!","So years ago way back in 2015 is when I first experienced VR, It was in the form of google cardboard on my Galaxy S5. The lack of real fun games on cardboard left me with a bad taste in my mouth and I assumed that this would be the same crappy experience on a real VR headset. I can't believe how damn naive I was to believe that a real HMD like the oculus would be disappointing like cardboard, But damn I gotta say I was dead wrong, so wrong in fact that I'm mentally beating myself up about it. I should have bought a Rift years ago and can't believe I'm just now joining real VR gaming for the first time. I feel like a jackass tbh. I had a powerful PC too since 2013. I finally got to jump into some real VR games today now that my family went back home after staying over the weekend for thanksgiving. So I had a lot of time for myself finally. Today I played Robo Recall and that alone made me pause and just be in sheer awe at the experience I was having, It was like feeling like a kid again at the arcades, And not only was I having a blast but I was getting exercise too! After playing some beat saber today I was exhausted! But thats a good thing, I am 280 and overweight, This VR thing can definitely help me get more active and lose weight, Thats a WIN WIN in my book.

What I wonder is why wouldn't Oculus consider working with Microsoft to bring Rift S or Quest Link support to the new XBOX?  There seem to be a ton of positives for both companies, a lot of hard work is already done.

\+ XBox Scarlett (next gen Xbox) is a closed system with fixed specs, it would be MUCH easier to support both hardware and software wise when developing both drivers (for the headset) and software (games/experiences) when you know EXACTLY what your hardware performance budget would be on a fixed platform

\+ Scarlett will very likely already have the necessary physical connections (HDMI, USB3)

\+ Scarlett is a much easier point of entry for your average consumer (go to the store, buy console, buy headset), no longer worrying about CPU/GPU/USB bandwith, different hardward configurations, bad drivers, users trying to buy a shitty pre-built PC with underpowered components having a horrible first experience since set-up and configuration of a console is MUCH easier

\+ Much larger target audience for Oculus to sell software and hardware to, yes yes I know PC gaming is huge and global but again not anywhere as easy to get into as going to your local electronics shop and picking up a console

\+ Driver functionality is already on Windows platforms, would require porting but it's not from some exotic not well understood platform, yes XBOX has it's own set of architecture but with Microsoft pushing development to their platforms to be similar (write once port few) I don't imagine it would be hugely destabilizing to their already existing software

\+ No longer hands the future of VR on consoles to Sony, more reasons for developers to no longer think of Sony as the only place they can sell their software in that space

\+ Key differentiator for Microsoft, showing that they're open to working with products you already own, you can play games on a console OR PC with the same headset

I'm sure there would be a fair bit of work for both companies, MS would have to support Oculus from an OS level since all the tracking stuff would have to be done in the background (probably difficult to run both tracking software and games at the same time without OS level support for this.  Oculus would have to port a lot of their existing software and it's not clear how buying software would work since both companies have their own stores.  

Still to me the positives seem pretty significant for this sort of partership.",1575395027.0,0,7,196792

The thing I noticed that is bugging me is that the left hand side of the left lens is much blurrier than any other part of any lens. The right lens has good clarity right across the entire lens, but the left one definitely gets blurrier on the left hand side, and particularly on the bottom left hand quadrant of the lens. 

It makes looking at static things to my left difficult since the right lens is perfectly fine, but it doesn't quite cover the same field of view as the left lens.  It's not an eye sight issue. 

Anyone think this is an issue with my set?",1575343769.0,5,4,196792

I played luckys tail with the Xbox controller but realised without controllers it was rubbish and put it back in the box. Pre ordered touch and when it arrived (I bought 2 sets to get a 3rd sensor) thought that I had a problem with my 2500K mobo usb. I bought an Inateck 4 port USB 3 and seemingly ever few minutes of robo recall I maybe got 5 frustrating hours total out of it. I just decided my computer was to blame.

A few months ago I upgraded to a 3700X with a new x470 Taichi USB 3 ports all over the place. I just plugged everything in and set it up firmware update on the rift headset and ""black screen we cant find your headset"" I have stolen the Inateck 4 port from the old pc and installed that it only powers the rift headset. And still it seems any head movements outside of GENTLE seem to kill this thing.

The rift CV1 is a straight piece of trash isn't it? There is no way for me to fix this problem it's a hardware problem that seems to go away briefly if I smash the touch controller into the sides and back of my own skull in frustration.

I always loved the idea of VR fuck I hate this POS. I even bought H3VR assuming the new PC would fix my issues. What a waste of money.

Not having to worry about stupid sensors is great. The bad, for some reason I keep feeling ""sick"". I got my VR feet a long time ago, and have played on my CV1 for thousands of hours and only rarely have I experienced sickness since upgrading to a 2080 Ti.  
I think that 80fps, just really doesn't sit well with me. Paying $1k for a Valve Index is just something I don't see myself doing, so I am thinking of just returning my Rift S and staying with the CV1 for a while.  
Is this just an individual thing, or is this common? I'm a bit worried for newcomers to VR if my experience is any indication of the average experience.  
Don't get me wrong, I absolutely loved the crisp visuals of the Rift S, but for some reason I got sick, and also my wife who doesn't like VR(despite me constantly forcing her to try it) in either headset said that she felt that it looked ""less real"".  
My IPS is 67, is it due to this? Is it the lower FPS? I'm no FPS queen, I'm fine gaming at 60fps.

I have checked NVENC compression takes only ~5-7% of GPU performance.

 him for christmas, but things are tight right now so it's not possible.

oculus,"Massive Technical Issues, any help is appreciated","I just got a Rift S last night, and since I got home I've had nothing but issues. I installed the app (using the beta), and plugged the headset in, however, I can't pair the touch controllers to the headset itself. When I try to pair the controllers, the light on the headset turns orange from white, then goes off, then goes back to orange, meanwhile in the app nothing happens for a varying amount of time until I get an error saying that there's a hardware issue preventing pairing.   


In addition to that,  the headset itself has been randomly disconnecting from my computer (hardware notification displayport disconnect), then reconnecting, then disconnecting again.  


I've plugged an xbox controller in, loaded steam VR, and I was able to use it for roughly five minutes before I got an error message saying that the display adapter has disconnected. It'll then reconnect a few seconds later. That's the only time I've managed to get it even close to working. Any other time I try to start steam VR, the display port disconnects. This has happened every time I've tried to start steam.  


So far, I've updated the following driversr (USB, graphics card, oculus driver etc), altered permissions to allow all camera/microphone permissions, turned off disconnect to save power functionality, plugged the rift into almost every usb port on my computer (always plugging the usb in before the display adapter).  


Meanwhile, since I started this process, my other usb devices have started intermittently disconnecting

My specs on my computer are as follows  


Amd Radeon 290 graphics card (minimum card, but at this point i'm just trying to get this working)  
8gb ram  
AMD Ryzen 2700x processor

I sold it because, although I am a massive fan of VR and still super excited about it, I felt like I had seen everything gen 1 had to offer and the CV1 screen just wasn't cutting it anymore.

I still really want another VR headset, but I've decided that the Valve Index is the minimum I am willing to put up with in terms of overall experience, and I am not willing to pay that kind of price. So I'm waiting for either a price cut or a new headset.

As far as I can tell, no new VR headsets have been announced for 2020. Surely we will get something new from either the usual suspects or Hp, or Samsung? or have HP and Samsung given up on VR altogether? 2019 was a good year for VR in terms of numbers, and the market is expected to expand significantly over the coming years, so it's surprising no new headsets are even being hinted at.

I am also really surprised Oculus aren't releasing a high end VR headset for enthusiasts. I don't see why it couldn't co-exist with their current heasets.

oculus,Quest vs Rift S purchase and IPD problem,"Greetings!

I'm looking at purchasing either the Quest or Rift S at the moment. Those are the only options I have, can't get any of the other headsets on my country. I also cannot buy something and then return it later, so my purchase would be pretty much final.

I want to, mostly, play PCVR games. The issue is, I have a far IPD of 70.7.

I tested the Rift S for like half an hour and it wasn't catastrophically blurry, but there's the sense that something was not right and the image was not perfectly clear. Also somehow the FOV was really low. In my experience it was even lower than the PSVR fov, and the PSVR isn't great at all in any regard. Didn't try adjusting the eye relief slider before putting the headset on my face (only adjusted it after wearing the headset), but I don't know if that would make any difference on the FOV.

So then I was also looking at the Quest, since it has a mechanical IPD adjustment. However, it seems that a lot of people are having issues with Link (yeah it's a beta, but no guarantees that the experience will rival a native PCVR solution), and it's honestly a concerning. Between the lower refresh rate, video compression stuff and other issues that I saw people having such as image freezes and random crashes/disconnects, it makes me think that purchasing this one would be a bit of a leap of faith that eventually it will be pretty much as good as other PCVR headsets.

If the rift S had an ipd slider this would be an easy choice. Thanks facebook!

It will says in the Devices menu ""Oculus software requires restart"". Saturday and Sunday were both fixed in different ways. Today I can't get it working as the setups just throw the ""Sensors can't track headset"" error during sensor check.

Maybe I've missed something while searching for fixes, but I'll list everything I've tried below. It's clearly a software problem as I doubt I would get the same error 3 times, with it being software the first 2 and suddenly hardware on the 3rd.

Saturday
- Restarted software multiple times
- Restarted PC
- Disconnected and reconnected headset
- All of the above in multiple different orders
- Turned off and on camera access in Windows 10 privacy settings - WORKED

Sunday
- All of the above
- Reinstalled Oculus software (took 2 hours)
- Removed Rift S from devices in Oculus software and performed Rift S first time setup again - WORKED

Monday
- All of the above (minus 2 hour reinstall)
- First time setup results in either perpetual sensor check or ""Sensors can't track headset"" error

oculus,Modifying Rift S touch controllers to have a better grip button - Questions,"Hello everyone. I was considering 3d printing a sort of plate or new button to replace the current grip button to be bigger and offer more natural grip of in game items.

Keep in mind, this is assuming you have some sort of way to strap the controller to your hand, something generally like the index has.

My questions are:

Are the grip buttons capacitive? I havent encountered a game that uses it (or can't recall at this moment), if it is. This would most likely make this project dead in the water.

Would the community find this useable or interesting? Consider that this most likely would void any sort of warranty if the final solution requires taking the controller apart.

Any games that this could enhance? B&amp;S and Pavlov come to mind.

oculus,Oculus software fails to reinstall after removing all Oculus software and resetting Windows,"I am running an original rift on a computer I just use for gaming. I hadn't used the rift since February, so when I plugged it in it needed me to update the firmware. No matter how many times I tried to install the firmware, it failed. 

I then decided to just remove all of the Oculus software and reinstall. This failed to work either, as after downloading and on the ""installing"" stage, it will say that it failed to install and suggests rebooting and trying again. I did this several times, but it never seemed to progress any farther. 

I then decided fuck it, just remove Windows and reinstall it and see if that works (I really want to use the rift again). I moved everything off of Windows, did the automated reset and reinstall and chose to wipe everything. I just finished that process, and tried to install the Oculus software again, and it has failed, again.

oculus,Yet another Rift S vs Quest report,"I'll try to keep it short.

I own CV1 and OGO and ordered Rift S to potentially replace CV1 and Quest to potentially replace CV1 and OGO.

Here are my findings.

**Rift S**

\-Clarity: ridiculously good, much better than expected. Why were so many people claiming that it's only a small improvment to CV1? For me it's a massive step. I can not just read things more easily than I could before, I can easily read things that I wouldn't have thought were even possible to read in VR.

&amp;#x200B;

\-No more god rays, yay!

&amp;#x200B;

\-Sweetspot? The whole lens is a massive sweetspot. I can look with my eyes in all directions and I don't need to waste any time with adjusting the postition of my headset all the time. This probably also why they can get away with no IPD adjustment.

&amp;#x200B;

\-The cable is longer, yay, I can turn my PC back to facing the right way...

&amp;#x200B;

\-Audio: they've got to be kidding me. I was expecting bad, but this is a joke.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Tracking: didn't notice anything out of the ordinary.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Comfort: I was scared at first, since design reminded me of the terrible Odyssee+ but I have to say: it's even better than CV1.

&amp;#x200B;

\-FOV: this feels really tight, maybe it's the price you pay for the huge sweet spot.

&amp;#x200B;

\-What's that button on the bottom? A mechanism to adjust the distance of the lenses to the face? Wow. Why wasn't anyone talking about this? Will make it much easier to maximise FOV and allow glasses wearers to try the headset.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Passthrough: OMG. Game changer. Put on the headset, don't take it off to have a drink, speak to the wife, get my chair, find my keyboard etc. You can even use it as an AR device where you walk around the room, from one huge screen to the next.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Negatives: Audio, Audio, Audio, and the cable is much more ""sticky"" compared to CV1. Will try to fix it using a mesh sleeve.

&amp;#x200B;

**Quest (Link)**

\-People wern't kidding, it's uncomfortable immediately. Nowhere near Odyssee+ levels of uncomfortableness, so not a complete show stopper, but investing time and money to fix it isn't very appealing to me.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Hello god rays, hello SDE, I missed you.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Visuals: better than CV1, but not close to Rift S.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Audio: same as Rift S.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Supports passthrough but not by double-tapping a button. Wtf?

&amp;#x200B;

\-Volume buttons! Why couldn't they add this to Rift S?

&amp;#x200B;

\-Performance: terrible, smooth 80/90 in Skyrim on Rift (S), 36fps on Quest? What gives? Investigated and it turns out that Quest link has a much higher render target resolution than Rift and Rift S. After reducing it using Debug tools performance was fine, but the fact remains that ASW at 36fps isn't the same thing as ASW at 40 or 45 fps.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Can I sell my OGO? Nope. Many apps aren't available at all, like the Felix and Paul documentaries or Pigasus player. There is no way to switch user accounts other than factory reset (I have two accounts, one for Rift, one for OGO). Sideloading OGO apks to Quest will mostly result in ""entitlement error"", regardless of whether it's a free or paid app, or if it's an app I bought on the active account.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Untethered Quest native apps: for me 72 fps is not really enough buttery smoothness and playing untethered in the same space in which I could just use a cable doean't really seem like a game changer. A game changer would have been if the Quest library had taken off as a VR console with AAA exclusive games like on Switch. But it didn't turn out that way, Quest library are just low-spec and expensive versions of PCVR games. While in the mean time PCVR gets HLA, Asgard's, Stormlands and Boneworks.

&amp;#x200B;

**The verdict**

Rift S much better than I was expecting, just need to buy the Koss speakers. I wanted to like the Quest but for me it has almost zero advantages over the Rift S.",1575928083.0,3,2,196792

oculus,"Should I gift my father the Oculus Go, or Quest?","So I had my father over a few days ago and showed him Google Earth in VR on my Rift S, and it completely blew him away. He isn't much of a gamer, though he used to be and I could see him going that direction if given a low maintenance option (Rift S and gaming computer certainly is not in the cards). He told me he was thinking about getting something for VR in the near future so I figured this might be the perfect gift for him if I can narrow it down to the right device. I understand that there is a 200 dollar difference and that with the quest you're getting two controllers versus one, and access to more games. How substantial is the spec difference between these two? Is one more user friendly than the other? My gut tells me he is more than likely going to stick to non gaming experiences with the VR, but I'm hoping you all might be able to provide more insight on what he's really going to get out of the Go or Quest.

oculus,"Serious troubles with Rift S, should I consider returning?","Hey everyone!

The other day (4 days ago) I got my Rift S, and to be completely honest setting it up and getting it to work has been a nightmare that hasn't yet ended.

Don't get me wrong, the headset is great &amp; I'd love to keep it but at this point I either need someone to help me out NOW or the headset is being returned to retail.

Basically, problem 1:  
The right hand controller is only half functioning, half of the ring is out and the other half has IR lights that are extremely dim.

Problem 2:  
When the rift is plugged in &amp; running on my head my internet just conks out, kaput, gone. No idea why, I've attempted to change channels &amp; try running only on 5.0ghz but this has not changed anything at all. (I've tried resetting my internet multiple times too &amp; am unable to use an Ethernet cable)

Problem 3:  
The headset has to be uplugged &amp; replugged in almost every time I first start my PC, and even then sometimes it wont start correctly, forcing me to unplug the cable from the HMD, which 100% of the time fixes the issue.

Have I tried troubleshooting all of these? Yes. I've restarted my computer multiple times, I've messed around with my PC settings (USB power saving etc), I've re-installed the software 3 times now &amp; have tried repairing the install a couple times too &amp; many more methods.

I've tried holding on to it but really at this point I think it's a lost cause, I've been in contact with Oculus but having to wait 2 days for every response is not worth it. It's basically just been 4 days of trying to get the thing to work properly and I don't think the issues are justifying the high price spend.

I don't know if I'm just unlucky or doing something wrong.

Does anybody have any possible solutions to my issues before I end up sending it back to the retailer?

I don't mean to sound rude or dismissive, I am a huge VR enthusiast finally getting into the PC VR market and so far it's just been stressful and if possible I'd love to stick to this headset but these issues are killing me.

oculus,Question regarding Oculus Link and more,"Hello everyone!

I have been saving up for my first VR headset, and I think I have decided on the Oculus Quest. My only problem is that I currently have an NVIDIA GeForce 1050 Ti, and from what I have read Link doesn't seem to support it. My question is- Does anyone know if this graphics card will be supported in the future, or is it just too old? I also have an AMD Ryzen 5 1600 for my CPU just to put that out there if it matters, but I think it is good enough (I don't know computers that well).

Another question that might be harder to answer is- If Link will not support my graphics card, do you think I should just get the Rift S, or should I upgrade my graphics card and then get the Quest? The only problem with this is that it would take me significantly more time to save up for both of these things, and one of the main reasons I want to get a VR headset is to play Steam games (like Elite Dangerous and Boneworks). So in this scenario, would I just be better off with a Rift S? I have heard some people say that the Rift S might become obsolete, and with Link it makes the Quest better in almost every way, but for someone in my position, do you think I should care to this extent? 

Sorry to make this post so long, but with so much money I want to make sure I have considered all my options.

I'm aware that right now there is no ""AAA"" VR game (at least until HL: Alyx), but through ports like Skyrim VR, Fallout VR and unofficial ports like Doom 3 BFG, you can experience really long games in a completely new light.

Ports like these fascinate me, and since I'm a long time fan of the Elder Scrolls series, I wondered if there was a Morrowind port. I found that there was one made a long time ago, called Morrowrift, but that unfortunately didn't have motion controller support and was eventually abandoned.

I'm of the philosophy that if something you want doesn't exist, you should make it, so I set my sights on making a new Morrowind VR port with the new OpenMW engine, since I could have access to its source code.

I know this probably would not work to well and would not be to precise, but my long term idea is to put magnets in haptic gloves to help simulate resistance and pull.

Just a thought that maybe some big shot will see this and think OH YEAH! that is the idea we were missing for good vr gloves.  Probably not tho :(

oculus,Some Love for Westworld Awakening,"Westworld Awakening has been sitting in my Oculus library since launch day and I finally got into it, and boy am I glad I did. I’m not seeing too much love for the game on this subreddit, so I thought I’d share mine.

This is perhaps one of the best VR narratives that I’ve had the pleasure of experiencing, and that’s what this is: an experience mixed with gamey puzzle elements. The polish on this title has blown me away. It’s environments are visually stunning and although the game doesn’t have you shooting and blasting your way out of DELOS, it does have you ducking for cover, sneaking past enemies, and scanning items in the world, all in an effort to further the narrative it’s trying to create--and with great success.

You play as a female Host named Kate, who is programed to experience a living hell day in and day out. Like I said before, you’re not the one doing the hunting and shooting in this story. There are people coming after you, and this game does its darndest to make you feel that way. I felt the sheer terror and vulnerability of being a host, destined to die. It’s astonishing and frightening, much more than I initially anticipated, though it should be noted that it’s not always this way. Westworld Awakening expertly balances horror, adventure, and mystery throughout it’s 4 chapters.

One of the things this game does best is immerse you through its dialogue and characters. Though there aren’t too many to keep track of, those you encounter will be memorable, as you find that most things aren’t what they appear to be. You spend a lot of time listening to a dude through an earpiece, but the dialogue between your character and the guy is so good, you can’t help but feel like you’ve gotten to know the two.

After each chapter, the game will ask if you want to continue, and I always found myself doing so. Similar to the TV show, each chapter leaves the player on some sort of cliffhanger that has you begging to find out what happens next, and that’s just evidence of compelling story-telling. While the story itself isn’t complicated, the way the game puts you in the center of the action makes it that much more engaging. The ending was pretty good. I think it could have been wrapped up with a better final scene, but I was ultimately left satisfied. I think you’ll definitely find it more appealing if you’re a fan of the series, but even if you know nothing about the show, the game gives you enough context throughout your adventure so that you’re not left feeling like some sort of interloper of the fandom.

The only bug I ran into was once when I had to scan objects on walls, but because I already moved made my way into different rooms while the dialogue was still going, I wasn’t able to continue because I assumed progressed too fast and the game got confused. On the flip side, the game does quick-save constantly, so you’re able to reload checkpoints and they’ll spawn you not too far from where you left off.

In terms of locomotion options, both are smooth, and there is no option for teleportation. By default the game is set to arm swing locomotion, where you'll move forward and in the direction your headset is facing when you swing your arms back and forth as if you're walking. Personally, I'm not a fan, so I switched to smooth locomotion via joystick. I don't think the game came with this option when it first released, so kudos to the devs for the update! Also, there's both snap and smooth turning.

Game-length wise, the game spans 4 chapters, with each chapter taking me roughly an hour to complete. I don’t feel as if I rushed through it, but I saw what I wanted to see and read what I wanted to read. Depending on if reading logs on a tablet is your kind of thing, this game may take slightly longer or shorter.

The title is currently on sale on both Steam and the Oculus Store for $29.99, and I wholeheartedly recommend it!

It has been as cheaper on clearance, but this is still a solid deal at almost half off.  It comes in three colors so you can do patterns if you like.  It's also moisture-resistant and super easy to cut and work with so if you want to do a whole room you can cut it down to fit flush.

Probably not the best if you have carpet in your VR area, but I really like these types of mats underneath a round rug.

oculus,Probably scratched my lenses...best course of action?,"Hi there,

I have the Rift S since last weekend and so far am loving it. However, today I noticed smudges on the lenses, a bigger one on the left lense and a smaller one on the right lense, that I don't seem to be able to clear using a microfiber cloth: [https://imgur.com/a/HEUbTec](https://imgur.com/a/HEUbTec)

I'm wearing glasses and so far have been using the Rift S ""by the book"", only using a clean microfiber cloth provided by my optician, using the button on the headset to provide more space for the glasses and putting the heaset on like described on the oculus website. So I find it a bit annoying, mildly speaking, that the lenses are so sensitive they already caught scratches after one week/maybe 4 longer sessions, even paying attention to all the caveats.

Since I received the headset only one week ago I could potentially return it, but I got it through a special Black Friday deal, and if I were to buy a new one I'd pay 100€ more than I originally paid.

So what would you do in my case? The scratches are not that big, noticeable in VR when paying attention to it, but bearable. My idea would be to get prescription lenses from VR optician or Widmo VR (which one is better, is there any difference?) and if the scratches keep getting worse or start to annoy me more, use something like polywatch. Or do you guys have a better idea?",1575840520.0,3,2,196792
oculus,OG Touch Controllers have broken vibrations,"Hey, so I'm running the OG Rift on my PC (3600 and 5700xt) and the vibrations are messed up. Everything was working fine until Oculus auto-updated drivers. My PC would randomly BSOD during gameplay. I gave it like a week and updated drivers again. No more BSOD and I could play VR again. In Robo Recall, something didn't feel right, but I kept playing. It wasn't until I played Beat Saber when I really noticed the problem:

Touching the Sabers together usually gives a really nice vibration that's rather convincing. Instead, it buzzed for a fraction of a second and stopped. The same went for every time I hit a note.

I thought something was wrong with the motors and that they were breaking. I don't have the money to replace the controllers, so I decided to just deal with it. Then the weirder thing happened.

I have no Idea why, but in Superhot, the controllers vibrate for way too long than too short. Every time I pick up a weapon, it buzzes for 3 seconds. Fire: constant vibration. Finish the level and grab the pyramid? full 10ish seconds of vibration.

At this point I'm thoroughly confused. I'm pretty sure it's not the hardware cause it's different in every game I play. I found a similar thread that said to remove the batteries and reconnect them, but it did nothing. If anybody has an idea, I'll try it, cause nothing I've done has worked.",1575861470.0,1,2,196792

oculus,Anyone else have had a hard time with shipping because Oculus forgot the commercial invoice?,"Ordered my Rift S the 29th during the BF promo. After my card denied the transaction on the 30th (flagged it as fraud), Oculus Support responded to my ticket within 30 minutes and my transaction was fixed.

It shipped last week and my package was supposed to arrive on Thursday. On Thursday, will keeping track of my package, UPS say they are returning the package to sender. I call UPS and they inform me that the sender forgot to put the commercial invoice on the box, so they can’t ship it to Canada and that I should contact the sender (Oculus).

I then proceed to open a ticket explaining the situation, waiting a day without answer. After a live chat with an agent, they inform me that I would need to wait for them to receive the returned package and then wait 4 business days for them to investigate. I inform them that it seems like a pretty long delay and that in about 2 weeks I will be away on vacation without internet access, which is a bit troublesome given the situation. I said it would be much faster to simply send a new unit, as the error is on their part and the package never even left the US.

A day later, someone else replies to my ticket informing me that I will be receiving a reimbursement in 5-7 business days and that I would be able to re-order another Rift S by then, ensuring that I update my shipping info (implying there was an error with my shipping info when there wasn’t at all, I checked).

I responded that I did not want to order a new Rift S at full price when I bought mine at the BF reduced price. I contacted the live chat and the agent told me that he forwarded that to a new team which will respond to it in 4 business days.

Is this really supposed to be this way? I feel like this is getting ridiculous as I made no error placing my order and now I’m stuck on knowing nothing about what or when anything is going to happen.

Did anything similar happen to any of you? What was your experience? How did it get fixed?

Ironically, possibly the only situation where having only USB 3.0 for your I/O is a downside. That's right. Not a single lick of USB 2.0. Rear I/O, 3 separate dual USB 3.0 ports side-to-side. A thunderbolt port. And just the standard video/audio ports. Two USB 3.0s on the front too, dang.

Oculus recommends putting any 3rd or 4th sensor on USB 2.0. Many say this is helps prevent any tracking issues. I reckon it's because having 3+ sensors gobbling USB 3.0 bandwidth is a sure way to slow things down. 

Thankfully, I have USB 2.0 extension cables laying around.

If the ground looks too far, *facing the wearer*, slide the IPD left (smaller IPD).  If the ground looks too high, slide right (larger IPD). Wait a second for eyes readjust, then refine until they say it looks right.

I don't have a ton of space in my room, so I generally do just a standing experience at the moment.

&amp;#x200B;

I currently have 3 VR headsets at home: Oculus Rift S, Quest and now even an Index.

The FOV of the Rift S is so bad I just can't play with it anymore and am now in the process of selling it. The FOV of the Quest isn't alot better then the Rift S but it feels so much better and immersive while the Rift S takes me complete out of the immersion. So I even prefer to play with the Quest through Oculus Link then with the Rift S.

Some people might say it's because of my IPD (it's not I have 63)  or because of the cover and it's not close enaugh to my eyes but no, I am able to put the headset that close to my eyes until I see all 4 edges of the screen, it looks like I'm watching through a carboard box which is even more immersiom breaking, and still the FOV is much smaller then the Quest while I can't see any edges of the Quest.

&amp;#x200B;

So that is the only reason why I bought the Index. I really like the Oculus software, the tracking, the controllers, and the screen of the Rift S but the FOV is just too small for me.

The Quest seemed to have the most bang for buck on the market because of its standalone and pc link capabillities.

I bought it tried it, and these are my impressions so far:

Pros compared to the gear vr:
- coming from a Gear vr positional tracking is a game changer foe me
- everything seems clearer, more optimized and snappier
- i love the 3d outside camera
- having hands inside the quest, much much better than the gear vr controller
- link
- standalone
- i use floorplanner.com for floorplans and now im able to walk around in the 360 vr exports of my floorplans

Cons compared to the Gear vr:
- there is some light refraction visible on the lenses
- there is some space around my nose where outside light comes trough
- eye strain after 10 minutes which worse and worse untill im unable to use the quest around the 15 min mark

oculus,Christmas: Quest + Link or Rift S? Oculus Store or Steam?,"Hello Friends

It's the old Question... What should I get for Christmas? 

I heard the Rift S has better visuals and (besides apparently lower resolutions) sharper images. Quest has better colours and a higher resolution per eye (but not as sharp pictures, even with Link) and apperently gets more support from oculus (handtracking, for example) 

I mainly want to play games and watch Movies with my future headset. 
The Quest has apperently more opportunities but the Rift is more comfortable. 


And because it matters: I have a gaming Laptop with a RTX 2060. And I am a guy who enjoys having good graphics 
(Would the Quest doesn't have the Link, it would be a no-brainer for me, but now the wireless seems like a really cool additional feature, which could be nice to have...)

Oh, and because I am posting anyway.

When both Ocolus Store and Steam offer the same game (for the same price) where should I buy it?

oculus,"Just got Rift S, disappointed in my Systems Performance","I just got my rift S yesterday and I am a bit disappointed in the performance. I started off with a few demos like The Lab on steam, and some simple games like Sports Scramble on the oculus store. So I decided to get a more demanding game, Stormland.

Have a 1070 ti, i7-4790, 16 gigs of ram and in Stormland if I run it on medium or high settings the frame rate drops to 40hz in most places and aws kicks in. I have to run it on low settings to get 80 hz. What would improve my performance the most, a CPU upgrade since that is older? I thought the 1070 ti was still in the top 10 cards.

I have also read that this game in particular might be harder than other newer games to get good performance on so I am not sure.",1575819633.0,1,7,196792
oculus,Oculus should really release more facial interfaces for the Rift S or at least release some CAD files so other can do so.,"My biggest gripe with my VR experience lately is that the facial interface just doesn't fit my face well and it's not very comfortable compared to my old CV1.  I have bought every 3rd party accessory I can find to improve the comfort but at the end of the day, the thing is just not shaped right for my face.   Maybe one day VR cover will release a new plastic interface, but I feel like this is an easier problem for Oculus themselves to solve, and an important one to address if they want to continue to grow the user base.

If you want to reduce friction to get people into VR, comfort is REALLY important.  I can be playing the best game in the world but if I'm feeling discomfort ON MY FACE of all places it's kinda hard to keep playing.  The HMD is a piece of clothing basically and the facial interface is where the HMD meets the face, it's really important, but so far is has not really been treated as such.

I see a lot of people on here over the years with the same problem and it seems pretty obvious it needs to be addressed.  People have all kinds of different face shapes and a one size fits all solution is doomed to leave many people uncomfortable.  

 All that Facebook money is great for doing the big R&amp;D stuff like varifocal lenses and cool new robot vision, but this problem is just molding some plastic a few different ways so people can be more comfortable.  This is low hanging fruit, but a big deal to the users.  

At the very least outsource the problem to the community and let us solve it but with some support from Oculus to help.  3d printers are pretty common, just give out the specs for printing the snaps so people can build their own and maybe sell them on etsy or something.  Or just sell a plastic plate with the snaps that we can glue our own solution to.  Or go all next level and do some kinda face scanning software that lets us 3d print a custom fit plate, that would be so Batman/Carmack.  And on the next headset, the magnetic snaps like the Index is using are a good idea, just copy that and make it easy for us.

I've had the CV1 for almost 2 years now (got it for Christmas from the best wife EVER) and I'm curious to try the Rift S.  I haven't used my CV1 for a few months, and wanted to get back in to Elite Dangerous and really wanted to see a resolution bump.  I've heard so many great things about the S, but my worry is that it might not be quite good enough to justify spending $550 to buy when I already have a CV1.  I looked up online where I could try the Rift S, drove an hour to the Microsoft Store in Square 1 Mississauga, only to be told that they removed the demo unit from the planagram a month ago.  Of course, it still (to this day) says you can try it out there.  There is no where else in Canada on Oculus' website that says where you can try it.  Best Buy says you can't return VR once its been opened, thus I'm in this pickle.

The things that worry me are:. 
1: Low field of view. 2: visible pixels. 3: Bad sound quality. 4: washed out blacks. 5: cheap foam that can't be removed. 
  
My IPD is 63.5mm, so I guess that would be ideal?
  
I'm also thinking that it might be better to wait for a future product that could be better, but perhaps that won't happen for a long time?

oculus,I'm happy to say Boiling Steel is really good.,"If you like Sci fi shooters, killing lots of robots and just having a good time, this game might be for you.

Boiling steel is really fun imho. I have played it now for about 2-3 hours and I'm nowhere near the end.
It starts off somewhat basic, lots of boring dialogue and initially the shooting seems kinda basic. But the more you play you realize this part of the game was essentially an extended tutorial.

The real game starts after the third or so mission, maybe about 30 to 40 min. After that the game greatly opens up, allowing you to select your own mission and even do bonus missions for special rewards. 

The way the game works you are essentially a human who operates robots remotely. Something happens at the beginning of the game that makes all sorts of robots go crazy and attack the humans. It is up to you to find out what happened and how to fix it. I can't say much about the story but at this point I'm certainly intrigued and want to see where it goes. I've already seen one or two revelations  that intrigued me.


You go in missions, get rewards and upgrade your robot and your weapons. This ain't an rpg but there's certainly a progression system that you feel yourself getting stronger and more capable. 

The starting weapons are extremely weak and little by little they are getting better. But one of the most interesting things of the game is how you equip/ reload these weapons. 

You basically hold the grip button of your non dominant hand and a hologram shows up with your long range and your short range weapon. Then with your other hand you grip the hologram and expand it. Then the weapon materializes in your hand.  According to the story they are being ""teleported"" from somewhere. There's no reloading. Once the weapon runs out of ammo you have to do this all over again. 

So far all the weapons I've gotten are two handed but they are all pretty varied and have different handling and uses. 

The missions are usually pretty basic, go here, unlock this, open this gate etc but the combat is what really shines. Theres several types of enemies and they are pretty good at taking cover, throwing grenades and rushing you. 

Overall the combination of the combat, the weapon system, the story, the progression has made this game pretty enjoyable for me. 

For 20 bucks, you hardly can go wrong. I'm playing this on viveport and the viveport version actually supports oculus home from what I can tell. Runs as smooth as any native oculus game that I've seen. No hitches or anything. And also a lot of settings to tweak for comfort etc (game defaults to headset orientation) 

Give it a try, I'm sure if you are a fan of single player  shooters you will enjoy this a lot.

Edit : apparently the game is about 4 to 5 hours long according to the dev with more hours to be added as the game progresses in early access. (probably should have mentioned it is early access)

Another big criticism is that the game is definitely budget and indie. A lot of the voice acting is actually text to speech (a computer is talking to you). And the levels are reused for the missions.",1575761128.0,9,1,196792

First off, we’d just like to say thanks to everyone who has supported us so far and welcome any newcomers to N1NE: The Splintered Mind.

We’re so grateful for all the support and feedback for the game we’ve received since we released our Alpha reveal trailer.

Today we are making an [announcement](https://www.od1nstudios.com/n1ne-the-splintered-mind-development-update/) that the team here has thought long and hard about. It’s not an easy decision for us but we feel it’s the best way for us to deliver a game that has a level of quality we as a team can be proud of.

And so, we are delaying the release of N1NE: The Splintered Mind Part 1.

We’d like to explain our decision making process in hopes of better communicating with all of you and strike a level of understanding for why we made the choice.

We also want to give you an update on where we are at and a look into the game, so we've written a blog post on our website with some additional info and new screenshots.

oculus,Unpopular Opinion - I prefer Rift S to Valve Index,"Hey All, fairly new to VR here. Little backstory  

&amp;#x200B;

I ordered a Valve index a few weeks ago, and was super excited. Boneworks, then HL:A, and Asgards Wrath (through Revive), I was just so excited! So excited in fact... That I couldn't wait to jump in, and ran out and bought a Rift S to play in the meantime, and maybe gift to my nephew once my Valve Index got in. I have been OBSESSED! I spent a ton of money on the steam VR sales, black friday oculus sales, and have been having a blast. But in the back of my mind was always the thought - ""This is going to be so much better when my Index comes in!""

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to this last Monday, got my Index, set it up (pain in the ass) and started playing. I was immediately disappointing. my first complaint was how much heavier the headset feels compared to my Rift S. It's noticeable, and I was constantly aware of it. Second issue - my play space is too small for the Steam VR ""full room scale"" chaperone set up (Valve's version of guardian"" so I couldn't even use it! I love my Rift S guardian, and has saved my ass a ton of times when playing Blade and Sorcery! Third issue, the cables dangling genuinely felt heavier, I noticed them more. It's a thicker cord, it weighs more than the Rift S, and it's noticeable. Forth issue (and it's a big one) I kept noticing these massive shines coming through my lenses while playing.. Like glare of some kind. I thought I had a defective unit, until I learned that it's something called ""Godrays"" and BOY is it bad. Like, REALLY bad when comparing to my Rift S. it was a constant distraction and I noticed it all of the time. 

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly? The amazing Oculus exclusives, eco system, recent innovations coming out of the Oculus team, makes me really excited about the future and investing into the Oculus eco system. Yeah, the on-board speakers suck ass, but I have a really good computer speaker set up, and just crank the volume when playing in my office and it works fine for me. 

Is it just me? Am I crazy? i don't get what is so amazing about the Index? 

Anyways, that's my two cents. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - I much prefer the Oculus Rift S over the Valve Index having owned both of them, and will be returning the Index for a refund.",1575694071.0,32,68,196792

I just picked up a Rift S on black Friday and for some reason when I try to use it I get stuck in a loop of ""Oculus software restart required"" constantly.

It almost always says the stuff about having to restart the software but occasionally it says something about having no display port connection, though that is pretty rare.

oculus,Getting fed up with the Guardian system.,"This just isn't working for me. I need to switch off the Guardian system to play Elite Dangerous, Dirt Rally games, Project Cars 1 &amp; 2, etc.. Every time I switch it off I am never in the center of the view, it's always to the right of me. If I goto the Steam VR settings, reset my seating view, reset my head view and I am back in the center - the Steam view you see before entering a game with the stars, distant mountains and a grey area at your feet - this grey area is in the center. Run a game, any of the above games I mentioned, and I am back to left of the grey area - so as I look down it's to the right of my view. So, in any of the games, I am either outside the car, outside my ship in ED, outside of any sitting down game.  
Of course, I can't just move to the right because my PC is where I need to be sat at, so a move to the right and I am not sitting at my PC.  
At the moment, the only way out of this is to switch the Guardian system back on, grab a chair and sit directly in the middle, but then my PC is way to the left of me.  
This is just so damn frustrating because one would think that switching OFF the Guardian system would also switch off any need to have a center of anything, the center should always be your headset.

oculus,Nostos First Impressions,"FYI: I never played the beta but heard some pretty bad things from the community and recently from Eric for President. I decided to give it a go anyway.

I played it for \~15-20 excruciating minutes, and then had to stop because it was so unenjoyable. Couldn't run it on high settings--it was a stuttering mess, so I turned it to low. Still a stuttering, janky mess. It's the kind of nauseating thing that VR games often do when they're loading, where a still image flickers rapidly and you become disoriented as you move your head. Let it be known that this game doesn't give you advanced video options. It's just Low-Medium-High.

The first red flag is at the very start, where this little robot thing asks you to calibrate yourself, then asks if you can see yourself in the mirror. It motions at the ground as if to tell the mirror to come up and, as if in an attempt to be funny and charming, the mirror doesn't show up until 10 seconds later. The arms on my girl avatar, according to the mirror, was way off. When I had my hands by my side IRL, the model had its right hand in her body toward the middle.

When you finally enter the game, you get this wrist watch thing ever so slightly reminiscent of what you get from Stormlands but not nearly as functional or just plain good. You can access it sometimes, other times, you can't. I tried changing graphics options from inside the options menu, but couldn't. The only way to do so is to return to the menu screen.

Let's talk about controls/gameplay. Maybe it's just me, but moving around felt like there was some sort of input lag so you end up gliding forward much longer than you want to. To run, you hold the grip which launches you every which way, making it even hard to control where you are. I played as a dude and somehow, some way, without clear directions, ended up in the open wild. Decided to shoot some deer with the pistol they gave me but I had to lead my shots an unreasonable amount. It dropped a slab of meat. Once I ran out of ammo, I had a landmine at my disposal, but it was virtually useless. Two bandits came up to me and started shooting me so I tried to punch them--there was audio feedback, but their HP didn't appear to go down. Once they'd shot me to the ground, one of the npcs game to my aid but started losing the battle, so I was left on the floor to die.

There's no tutorial to speak of, which left me confused about how things worked. That's not a good sign.

Over voice-chat, you can hear people going, ""What the \*\*\*\* is this? How do you do this/that? What's going on? Why is it loading forever?""

For what it's worth, it's a good looking game and from what I saw in the main hub, seems like there's a decent amount of people trying Nostos out too.

But this doesnt feel early-access. This feels early-*early* access.

For those of you who've tried it, what are your thoughts?",1575681615.0,11,11,196792

We released new free DLC for Swords of Gargantua, called Tesseract Abyss!

It's a rogue-lite mode that can be done solo or through multiplayer. Players move downwards into the ""abyss"" fighting in different areas that are chosen from a random selection after each stage.

Along the way you'll earn power-ups, can collect weapons, craft them into stronger weapons and level up your own character's base abilities. There'll even be a shop that appears from time to time which you can buy items (like power-ups and health) through the coin you earn by winning battles.

If you die, you'll carry everything over into the next play minus your initial level. It's pretty tricky so you'll most likely die a few times. Looking forward to seeing everyone progress through it!

oculus,How to Narrow Down the Right VR Headset,"For the last week I have been on a VR rampage, getting my hands on several different headsets in order to find the best experience for me. To find the headset I would be willing to live with for the next few years. I had read reviews, did my research, but I felt a lot of the feedback I was hearing was unfocused. People were hesitant to recommend things because things weren't 100% good about any one headset. Conversely, there were many things that people valued far more or less than others. Well, I want to solve that problem by narrowing down use cases. You decide what is most important to you by seeing what scenario fits. This is, of course, from my own perspective.

*You will need to know some basic information about the Steam Index, Oculus Rift S, and Oculus Quest to make sense of this guide.*

**Pre-Requisites:**

What do you need prior to playing VR with the kits below?

* Index: Super Computer. 1080/2080+
* Rift S: Gaming computer. 1060/2060+
* Quest: None. All in one solution.

**Mobility:**

A rating of how easy it is to move your configuration. The wired headsets here are not too difficult to play in seeing as the wires are greatly improved from last gen, so that's less of an issue.

* Index: Dedicated space recommended. Since it uses tracking beacons the best way to get them to work is to mount them. Wires need to be managed regardless of if they are mounted on a wall or a tripod. Moving this system is definitely going to take effort and it's unlikely you will want to move around with this system. If you don't have a dedicated space, or can't see yourself playing in the same space more than 80% of the time, this will be troublesome.
* Rift S: Mobile. The wire is very manageable, and with a dedicated VR laptop (That needs Mini-DisplayPort connected to your GPU) you can be mobile. The headset has all the tracking tools built in, so you are surprisingly mobile. Play downstairs one minute and upstairs the next.
* Quest: Absolute Freedom. VR makes a lot of people conscious and worrisome about the world around them. Well, with the Quest, you have zero wires. It's the future of VR on a general level.

**Comfort:**

* Index: Very comfortable. A little heavy, but felt well balanced. Did not wobble. Best materials.
* Rift S: Comfortable. I would argue very comfortable, but the halo ratchet didn't always feel secure. I did not like the foam as much as the Index's cotton layered padding. Will definitely need Silicone or VR Cover.
* Quest: Comfortable. Most similar to the CV1 in terms of attachment. It requires a lot of fidgeting to get right, but I never had a need for a counter weight once I figured it out. I think people overstress the added ""weight"" as it's only \~70g heavier than the CV1 in the front. It probably helps because it adheres to your face more. There is more wobble on the Quest than the Rift S, but at the same time there are better comfort accessories for the Quest too. If you spend more money the Quest might edge out the Index.

**Visuals:**

* Index: A+. The best visuals I tried. No god rays, just light blooming. Don't be fooled by the fact that it's an LCD because when it comes to VR LCD is king. Don't mistake your monitor's contrast ratio with this thing. Just like TVs have specially adapted pixel configurations to increase contrast (or your iPad for instance), the VR headsets have the same. LCD has less banding, no speckle, and far less SDE. The improved refresh rate of the Index makes it the king of the three. If you get motion sick, the Index is the only headset that may resolve it.
* Rift S: A. Everything above, other than the refresh rate and FOV, applies here. This headset's visuals are not that far off from the Index and that's due to the lenses. The best analogy I can make is a 23"" 1080P monitor and a 27"" 1440P monitor. It's obvious the latter is higher resolution and more dense, but because the 1080P screen is smaller the density is similar (\~97 vs \~109 PPI) the difference isn't mind shattering. The reduced refresh rate is noticeable for owners of the CV1, but it doesn't harm the gaming experience. That being said, I own the 1440p monitor in this example and even though it's only 12 PPI that mattered to me. You might be the same?
* Quest: B. If you've used the CV1, you can think of this as a CV1+. It's unfair to say it isn't different, because text is far easier to read and god rays are greatly reduced, but there are similar OLED issues that remain. SDE is reduced but far more noticeable than the above headsets. Brightness suffers as a result. 72hz is noticeable, but has yet to affect gameplay for me. If you suffer motion sickness this headset might not be for you at all. There isn't jitter, but movement isn't as smooth. Pistol Whip is hard to play compared to on CV1. The B rating is above average though, so we're at a place where visuals aren't something you are suffering through, but simply something better exists.

**Controls:**

I don't think this is a significant talking point. I don't prefer the Oculus controllers versus the old CV1, but they aren't bad. Valve's controllers have additional features but they aren't really necessary in the VR world currently. You're getting a quality controller regardless fo what platform you pick.

**Value:**

* Rift S and Quest are the best value. The Index is a luxury item in my standards. For the money you pay, it delivers. But at some point you are happy with your iPhone X and don't need an iPhone XI. When you buy a Rift S or a Quest you aren't buying yesterday's product either, so there's no sense of ""I wasted money on old tech"". You are buying the newest products that Oculus has to offer. Valve's product is better, but not a better value.

**Sound:**

The Index is the only VR headset with a real audio solution. I'm a little weird in that I like the Rift S' open audio because it allows me to be more aware of my surroundings (and it's immersive because you hear audio without having your ears covered) but that's not the norm. I like it, but I still prefer the Index. Hell, even the CV1's headphones were great and they are missed.

With both the Rift S and the Quest you will need to invest money in another audio solution if you want headsets.

**Quest Link (beta):**

This is specifically for the Quest, but it's usually the most difficult topic regarding getting the Rift S or the Quest. For most people, the lower visual quality of the Quest in Link is worth the mobility and freedom. They just need to make sure Quest Link WORKS.

Quest Link is solid.

If you're playing native Quest apps and you have no issues with the loss of visual fidelity there (due to the mobile processor) and you just want to make sure you can play Half Life: Alyx or some other PCVR titles -- you're good. It works wonderfully for a beta. It's plug and play. The visuals are still great.

However, if you're thinking you want to be playing PCVR more often; if you bought a beefy GPU because you wanted awesome VR graphics and crisp visuals... Quest Link isn't that. It's like playing 1080p games on your 4K monitor. It looks fine, but it's noticeable. 

If you want Quest as a Quest, Link is an added bonus that feels like cheating at life. If you want Quest as some sort of value proposition between your gaming PC and Mobile VR, it's doable without major complaints. If you think Quest Link compares or replaces Rift S/Index in experience however, you're going to be very sorely disappointed. **I have no idea how so many youtubers and reviewers could ever say playing Quest Link felt no different than Rift S.** Just 1 minute in Link and I could easily tell. I'm not some magical gamer -- you'd have to be blind not to know. Whether you care or not is not the same as there being almost no literal difference. That is ***absolute bullshit***.

Perhaps they will fix it in future updates, but Quest Link has slight glitching in visuals every so often. Sometimes objects teleport a few inches (in game perspective) as the stream takes time to catch up during intense gameplay. Vader Immortal's Dojo showed this often when critters would pop up and move around. There's also a very, very slight lag in audio and controllers. I'd say you will never choose to play Beat Saber over Link. Score or Performance didn't drop for me much, but you notice the visual glitches. You will actively recognize that a block sliced open a little closer to your face than you're used to. However, you might be fine playing a game that is intense but not nearly as rapid -- like Stormland or Elder Scrolls VR. Using Half Life as an example again, I can see myself playing it over Link without many complaints.

**What Did I Pick?**

Playing *more* VR supercedes playing *better* VR, in my opinion. This is why I moved on from the CV1 to begin with; the increased visual fidelity was merely an unexpected bonus. While I fell in love with the Valve Index, I don't have a dedicated play area. I have to move between two spots depending on my opportunities so that narrows down my choice. Picking between Rift S and Quest was difficult, but I ended up deciding on the Rift S. Quest is fun without a tether, but I have a gaming laptop and the cord doesn't bother me so much. It feels no different to me than having wired earbuds on.

Happy Holidays and I hope you all find the headset you need!",1575665191.0,16,11,196792
oculus,Oculus Rift S - feeling underwhelmed - what am I missing?,"I hesitate to post a negative thread here but ive been really disapointed with my experience so far.  I've wanted an occulus since they were first announced years ago.  I pulled the trigger on Black Friday. 

So far, the highlight has been the tutorial demo.  I thought that was pretty amazing.  It's been downhill since. 

I installed Steam VR and downloaded one of the free rollar coaster games.  It was kind of cool but didn't feel immersive at all. 

I purchased vorpX and tried a few games. I got maybe two of them to work but again - I was not blown away.  

What am I doing wrong?  Do I pretty much need to only use apps and games purchased through the Oculus store to get the.same.experience that blew me away like the tutorial did?

I hope someone can help give me advice because otherwise this thing is going back to the store. 

Thanks",1575737529.0,0,39,196792
oculus,Oculus Rift S Headphone Jack Audio Issues,"So ever since I bought the Rift S I've absolutely loved it. I think the one persistent issue I've noticed since opening the Rift S is that my Apple Earpod headphones don't seem to want to sound right unless the jack is sitting in an absolutely specific position often moving back out of position during play which results in audio cutting out of the right headphone.  Sometimes even only plugging it in halfway will give me better audio in both headphones than all the way in which will cut out most of the right headphone unless you twist it just right.

And no, the headphones work perfectly fine in any other device and are not damaged near the jack. The Rift S Headphone Jack is super touchy with jack position. I usually only get this issue with cheap 3.5mm headphone extenders previously. More higher quality 3.5mm extension cords don't have this issue like the current one I'm using for my PC audio into these very headphones that give me issues on the Rift S jack.",1575702097.0,2,2,196792

Upgraded from a HP WMR that had zero FPS issues at 90Hz/FPS, got the rift S and having some problems, mostly at level loads or when something happens in the game (explosions, things spawning, etc) every few minutes.  
I'll get FPS drops and get visually smearing (looks like wet glass) as well as stuttering, even my controllers in game jerk around. CPU and GPU usage seem low at the time it happens.

Ryzen 1400 @ 3.9Ghz (stock vs OC makes no difference)  
16GB 2666Mhz corsair ram  
GTX 980 4GB (stock speeds)

CPU and GPU pass all sorts of benchmarks and dont pass 60C on CPU and 75C on GPU, CPU and GPU usage dont max out in task manager.

I'll test it out with my more powerful primary PC when this stutter induced migraine goes away, but could use some tips in the meantime",1575693460.0,3,6,196792

But, when I put it on it was just black.  It's connected to USB 3 port and had no problems updating firmware.

I ran the 'Oculus checker' software and my PC meets specs (nvidia GTX1060, 16G ram, USB 3, etc).

Has anyone else had this problem and been able to resolve it? I'm pretty upset that after buying it and making sure my laptop was fine that it's not working.

Edit: not sure why people are down voting this... with the black Friday sales I'm sure other people are likely facing the same issue.

So im in th emarked for a vr headset, and its down between the Quest and the Rift S. The issue is, im not gonna keep my pc in the same room as i would like to VR in. The computer room is to small to do much flailing around, and i dont wanna keep my pc in the living room, because i use it for other stuff besides gaming. So i need about 5-6m extension on the cables. Its also one of the reasons i dont care for the Index, cause id need to run a ton of cabling trough the middle of my apartment. 

Has anyone tried this? Would it be easier to extend the link with an active usb 3 cable? Or the rift S with a display port repeater and some aditional cabling? Would any of those options even work? At this point this seems to be the deciding factor for me, cause they both seem to have a bunch of advantages and disadvantages.

oculus,Don't sleep on Boiling Steel!,"We are suddenly blessed with tons of really good VR content. My library is already a guilt ridden mountain of unfinished games. Recently, we have had some real hard hitters - finding time to play though Asgards Wrath and Stormlands is hard enough. So, this is the first year I passed on the sales - I just do not need any new games. 

Then Boiling Steel comes along. I had my eye on this for some time, saw a couple of enthusiastic reviews (well, 'let's play's'). I thought, 'this game seems legit' - but I stood my ground... no new games 'till I clear some of the back catalogue.

Then I noticed Boiling Steel pop up on Infinity - so I downloaded it. Now I am going to buy it on Steam (Infinity - for me = good for demoing games that I will buy on Steam if I like them). 

Everything about this game puts it up there with the very best VR shooters (perhaps... even my current darling: Stormlands).

Graphics are really, I mean \*really\* good. Gameplay is solid and innovative, and everything about it just 'feels right'. 

There is a very different feel to most shooters (VR or not). You see, there are no health packs lying around (if you think about it - having convenient health packs just lying around - is pretty dumb, unrealistic and immersion breaking in any game). *Here* you have to conserve your health - get though by playing smart and taking as few hits as possible. Dash, forward to hit, or dash back to evade - fight more tactically. This gives the game some genuine tension and sense of achievement. There is no - 'I'll kill this guy, pick up his health pack and suddenly, I am 100% again'. 

The only bad thing so far is the voice acting - the main GI Joe voice is like fingernails on a blackboard. But that's it - everything else is up there with the very best. 

Putting this game out now is poor timing - had this come out before AW and Stormlands - I am pretty sure everyone would be flagging it up - and I fear many will pass, or not even notice what is a truly great game.

oculus,Anyone able to give me some advice on upgrading my PC ?,"Hi.
Owned an Oculus for about a year and I love it. My current system runs a heavily modded Skyrim VR smooth as butter but recent games like Asgards Wrath and Stormlands are starting to have issues so I'm thinking it's time to upgrade. Problem is, I'm not sure what. My PC has basically been hammered together over several years, I'm not even really sure what's in there at this point but a system scan tells me I'm running:

Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-6700K CPU @ 4.00GHz 

Radeon RX Vega 

16 GB DDR3 RAM

Windows 10 64bit

So my question is, what to upgrade ? I'd rather go heavy in one or two areas rather than a little boost across the board. I'm budgeting about £500 and I'd like to put in an SSD to improve loading times ( especially for Asgards wrath my 2 year old 2TB drive really doesn't like loading that game ) but should I go for more RAM or a faster CPU ? I could get a new graphics card but the Vega is only about a year old and should handle stuff pretty well.

so yeah. An SSD and what ? 64gig of ram or a fancy new processor ?

Any advice gratefully received.",1575687703.0,1,2,196792

No Man's Sky has exhibited some noticeable issues on my W10 system, which consists of:

i5 6600k (Stock)
Sapphire Nitro+ 5700XT 8GB OC
16gb DDR4 

Based on some light research, NMS in VR is very CPU intensive due to the nature of the game itself, which matches up with the issues I've had (slow to render/black portion of view when quickly moving head, stuttering when moving at high speed, and during star field intro/loading screen).

In search of a solution, I'm debating which upgrade path is the best and most cost effective for my predicament. The i7 7700k is the fastest CPU my LGA1151 board will accommodate. Can I expect this to provide a noticeable boost and the alleviation of these issues, or should I spend some more for a new AM4 motherboard with a Ryzen 3800x?

Mostly looking for opinions and first hand experience from those with a 7700k. Would I be wasting money taking that route? Also, maybe someone has a tweak in mind for NMS that makes a difference?

I've been searching around for answers and it seems that this question has been asked many times but never really answered other than ""revert to an older version of windows"" or ""format"" or ""update your drivers"".

It worked perfectly fine before but now it doesn't so if you are using DK2 be weary about updating. Unfortunately the error from the BSOD is ""IRQL NOT LESS OR EQUAL"" which relates to a memory leak of some kind. Unfortunately digging deeper into the problem I find that it's absolutely related to the USB exe file ""ntoskrnl.exe""

I tried Microsoft verifier, sfc scannow, memtest, checked drive for errors etc... No issues anywhere. It doesn't matter what cable I connect to the sensor, it just BSOD the moment the sensor turns on (config window or in-game) but does appear to work for a brief second.

oculus,360 degree video app that allows perspective change via controller in addition to head movement?,"I have an Oculus Go, I'm a very casual VR user, and I've been taking more and more 360 video since getting my Gear 360. Often I want to view this content in bed, on the couch, etc. where there are kinda constraints on moving around enough to see from any perspective. I say ""kinda"" because of course I \*could\* get up and move around, I just don't wanna, it's more effort than I want to expend.

The same thing would occur if you wanted to use the headset in an airplane seat. I imagine you'd have less than 180 degrees of head movement, you could become a pain to your seat neighbors pretty quickly. For a lot of casual content, even some games (i.e. Eclipse, Monument Valley), being able to control the perspective from the controller would be nice.

It's surprised me that almost no apps (that I've encountered so far) allow perspective change like this from the controller also.

What would be REALLY nice is some way at the system level of the Go to enable this sort of override for any/all content. This has to exist already, right? If a physically impaired user wants to use a headset, granted the immersion will suffer a bit, but this seems like a perfectly acceptable tweak to the navigation model.

oculus,Recent Oculus Rift S Experience,"Hi everyone. I recently got a rift s as part of the black friday sale and wanted to share my experience, mainly for anyone looking to buy the rift s.

Short version is that my first headset was quite simply, defective. The cable connection at the headset was extremely finicky and if you turned slightly it would disconnect. I plugged it back in multiple times, tried different display ports, different USB ports, even a powered USB hub, nothing worked. I also had the issue where my headset would occasionally stop tracking my hands and they would lock in place.

So after many hours troubleshooting, I returned it and ordered another. Got it today and works awesome! No issues setting up or with tracking, no black outs/ shutting off, and the connection to the headset is firm.

It's an absolute blast to get to play with a rift s that actually works lol. For anyone wondering, I play robo recall, Pavlov, and blade and sorcery.

oculus,(Rift S)Can we talk about this - Oculus Software Restart Required,"Many of you may have seen or heard about this issue, many others, like myself, may be one of the victims. If you have not heard about this issue, it is a problem that plagues primarily the Rift S from what I can tell. The problem seems to arise after a PC reboot after setting up the Rift S for the first time. When the Oculus Software starts, a notification appears on the Devices tab showing an issue with the Rift S. Clicking on the Rift S shows a message which says ""Oculus Software Restart Required"". Restarting all of the Oculus Software and services does not fix this message no matter how many times it is done, and the headset is unusable when in this state (black screen).

A quick Google search for Oculus Rift S Software Restart Required will reveal dozens of posts on various forums detailing this issue dating all the way back to late March and early June, right around the Rift S release. All of the many posts I've seen are filled with conjecture, hypotheses, and mundane troubleshooting steps which leave users in no better shape and no real answers. Some think it's due to USB driver versions, some think it's a power draw issue, some think it's an Oculus Software bug (my opinion), others think it's due to outdated graphics drivers or windows updates, but no one really knows. This issue has been affecting many users since launch, and the lack of any official statement by Oculus is concerning to say the least.

I'd like to hear from those of you who may have experienced this problem. If you created an Oculus Support ticket, what was the provided solution? Did the provided solution fix the issue? Did you try any troubleshooting yourself? Did any of those steps fix the issue? When did you start experiencing this, and what are the symptoms?

This would open the VR market to basically anyone with a pc and willing to buy a heaset (if you get a wmr heaset that’s only £200 to get into VR). If oculus or other company were able to get the developers on board, then you would be able to play the whole library of quest games, on limited pc power, and with an ecosystem mostly built.

For the record, I love gun controllers for games. I have the PS Sharpshooter for PS3 (Killzone 3 is fantastic with it). I even have a MAG II gun for PC and I experimented with wiimotes https://youtu.be/8OcXppjEgi8 and https://youtu.be/GyYm1s6y4RY. I got the PS4 Pro and the PSVR mainly for the aim controller. For VR I have the standard ProTube.

First some thoughts on PSVR and Farpoint. What can I say, apart from the fixed IPD (blurry edges with my 70mm IPD), having those early-game spidery things in Farpoint jump at me in a headcrab-like arc really gave me a chill down the spine. I have not felt that recently. And splashing them mid-air with the aim controller was such fun! For some reason, the robotic spiders in Robo Recall do not elicit the same primal reaction.

The haptics on the aim controller are quite good and really bring that feeling of actually holding and shooting a gun. Unfortunately, with the ProTube I get almost no haptics. The vibrations of the Touch controllers are very, very weak and they are even less noticeable when the touch controllers are in the ProTube cups.

So I have a question: does the ForceTube work well? Does it work in all games? How does it compare to other controllers like the PSVR aim controller and the PS Sharpshooter?",1575618283.0,1,0,196792

oculus,CV1 to Rift S - First Impressions,"I have tried the Rift S before briefly, and wasn’t sure about the comfort, but my wife got me one for Black Friday, so here are my impressions.  I am a 67-68 IPD

Also, to qualify this, I last used my Rift CV1 a couple days ago and won’t be able to use it again until next week (for reasons) so I can’t compare them directly.

Visual Quality

Awesome.  Huge improvement over the CV1.  The SDE is still there, but vastly improved and often not noticeable.  I thought the colors were just fine despite it not being an OLED.  I didn’t try it in Elite Dangerous or another super dark game though.  Clarity around the screen was great too.  Couldn’t get both eyes 100% focused but seemed clear when using it.  It did seem very slightly off though, hard to explain, I think because my IPD is too wide?  Not enough to notice 90% of the time, the the visuals were a huge bump up.
As for God Rays, they are massively reduced.  You can still see streaks of light from high contrast objects, but they are much fainter and softer, just a slight smear of light.

Comfort

The halo was comfortable once I got it set up.  The only drawback was it seemed like it took a lot more fiddling with it when I put it on.  The CV1 I could just slip on.

Tracking

Amazing.  I was expecting a slight downgrade from the CV1, but honestly it seemed as good or better.  I was sword fighting in Until You Fall (unrelated note, every one in awhile that game pauses with the hourglass figure, anyone know how to fix that?) and had zero problems.  Same with Robo Recall.  The setup was simple too.  

Audio

Ok, this is a downgrade.  Not as bad as I  feared (my previous demo was in a noisy store so couldn't tell then) but it is still a downgrade.  Not horrible though, you can still hear clearly.

Eye Strain

In a previous post I mentioned that I felt the Rift S caused some eye strain for me when I demoed it.  I spent some time trying different fittings to reduce that.  But after playing awhile, I am still feeling it.  I didn’t have this problem with the CV1.  I think it is just the price I will have to pay for a wider IPD.

I will update this next week after I have had more time to play and have my CV1 hooked up again to compare side by side.

Update 1 - I was asked about blurriness at the edges of the lens.  I don't think it is bad.  I mean yes it gets distorted when you look at the far edge of the lense, but it has a big sweet spot where it is very clear to look around with your eyes.",1575570028.0,10,21,196792

oculus,Rift S - Need for cover / VR Cover use?,"Hello,

Like many, I recently got an Oculus Rift S on black friday, and trying to be a perfectionist about it looked for accessories for it. I was disappointed to see that there weren't a lot of options on the market. I ordered the AMVR grips, which I will hopefully not regret (I barely saw other options here either), but the one thing I heard people talking about is that you should use a washable cover for the Rift S due to hygiene reasons. On further research I have seen that the one offered by VR Cover (which I heard was the best for these kind of things) for the Rift S was just a simple cloth you strap over. 

&amp;#x200B;

For the price it costs, it would cost just as much to just get a replacement headplate for the Rift S in case I needed one - and the VR Cover one also has basically no reviews to be found anywhere online. So I'm asking here: Anyone with experience - is the VR Cover worth it and are there better alternatives or other must-have accessories to further improve the care of my new (and first) VR headset.

 In the few games it's there, but easily ignore able unless I focus on it. .  Is this just something that sometimes happens or something I can correct by changing a setting? 

It's a minor distraction, and honestly if happened on both sides I would probably assume it's just a refresh issue and move on. Since it's only happening in one eye though, I thought it might be something I'm doing or a hardware issue.

oculus,Day One with Rift S. :),"Well, today I finally, after waiting like 5 years to get a headset, got the Rift S.

I also got the Sapphire Nitro+ 5700XT.

I've only used the headset for a few hours, around 6, and everything seems to be working great.

I played First Step, it has you push buttons on the controller, but there is a long delay between each scripted event, it kept making me think the thing had froze.  The desk comes out of the floor, and you have cubes to play with. Throw a paper airplane, and play with ping pong paddle and ball.

Then I noticed that it was awfully quiet, there was no sound. So I wanted to take the headset off, and decided to put the controllers on the desk in front of me, till I remember it wasn't real. LOL! Almost dropped them on the floor! Yikes!

The little flying robot felt like he was there, like I could reach out and touch him! Very cool!

When I first put the headset on, I was sitting down, and I started the wrong game, I meant First Step, but played the next one after that one. The floor was wrong, and I was up near the ceiling. I wanted to stand up, and get in place in my room, but there was equipment around my head, and it seemed so real, that my brain was telling me not to stand up, your going to smash your face into that. LOL!!! Unreal!

Anyway, after I took a break for food, and looked up some info, and then installed Steam VR. Very easy to do.

I had bought Space Pirate Trainer, a game I've been wanting to play for years now. :) Took all of about 2 mins to install Steam VR, and Space Pirate Trainer, and I was playing. Very smooth. I had less trouble with Steam, than Home. In Home, I couldn't find a way to recenter my view, so I had to face odd directions to play. Steam, made it very easy. 

Great game, the tracking is awesome. The guns in my hand seemed real, because they followed my every movement, as fast as I was moving them. I was holding the shield with the controller like under my chin, hiding behind the shield, and never lost tracking, I never lost tracking since I got the headset for that matter! :) Oh, and I played the whole time lying on my back!! :) I was tired, long day. :) Worked great though.

Then I used the Virtual Desktop in Home to watch a YouTube video. I made the screen huge. Video quality was great, like no screen door effect at all. Much better than I thought. I honestly never read anyone say how good the picture was, they always seemed disappointed.... After seeing it for myself, I don't understand their reaction.

People complain about the blacks, and the sound. The blacks are black enough, they aren't perfect, but very far from being a game breaker, and the sound is good, nice 3D Spatial audio, no you don't get hard bass, but you get a bit, I can live with it.

Zero motion sickness. I'm farsighted, and had zero trouble seeing with the Rift S. My eyes never got tired.

Computer Stats:
950watt Power supply, was running two GTX 480's, that's what I just upgraded from. :)
3770K CPU
Sapphire Nitro+ 5700XT 3 times faster than my 480's. :)
32gigs of ram
Inateck Superspeed 7 Ports PCI-E to USB 3.0 Expansion Card KT5002 using the far left port, if you're facing the back of your computer.

Make sure you usb ports power save is disabled. I had done it, but for some reason, it turned back on. Which caused the screen to go black, I had put the headset down for a few minutes, and wouldn't wake up when I put the headset back on. Had to reboot, this happened a couple of times, after that I rechecked those settings, and had to turn them off again....

Question, how do you watch a video, without hearing the crackling fire in Oculus Home the whole time?

So far, the Rift S has been great. Hopefully it remains that way. Need to get some sleep. :) Long day of VR tomorrow. :)",1575525830.0,27,22,196792

## Project Elysium #announcementsSERVERToday at 9:40 PM

The development team has successfully moved to the USA. After company registration, we had to create a new Steam profile for our company. The game is going to be pulled off the old account and uploaded there. A bit of an administrative workaround but we're looking forward to the future!  The old (Russia registered) account and Steam page will no longer be active. The new Steam page is going be available as soon as it finished. We will post another announcement by that time.  Oh and here's another screenshot cause why not.

oculus,"Best options for headset, Oculus Rift S","Alright so, I've been getting into VRChat pretty heavy recently, been having a good time. What's not a good time is every time I meet someone new they bitch and moan about my audio quality from the mic, and how it intermittently ""roboticizes"" and is just generally poor quality and makes unpleasant noises on its own accord. This has been ruining my experiences. So, since I'm also looking to supplement the also very poor speakers of the rift S, which honestly at this point are less of a bother than the even poorer mic, I figured the best way to do that is to buy a wireless combo headset. With that said, i tried the ps4 ones that my brother had and they were super loose and did not cup the ears well and wanted to fall off anytime I was playing something active. So, what have people had good luck with. I'm looking for something that foremost, snugly holds the ears and has good audio quality, as well as good mic quality. Now that I think about it, battery life is a big one too. I have been known to play for up to 6-7 hours at a time now that I have gotten my VR legs so it would be nice to not go mute halfway through.

oculus,CV1 to Quest (PC) first impressions [Technical and experience],"So having just gotten an Oculus Quest after a few months with a dead launch-day OG Rift I'm thrilled to be joining the virtual worlds again, also bare in mind that until my 3m Usb-C cable gets here in a few days I was using a 0.5m cable.

Setup was really easy. On my AMD R9 3900x system which uses an AMD Radeon 5700XT GPU and Gigabyte X570 ITX motherboard there were absolutely no problems whatsoever, it's simply one cable with no dicking about with sensors or the convoluted setup process. I had no issues getting the headset connected and it booted right into Home without any complaints or hickups. Here are the first things I noticed visually...   
   
The **field of view**, it is FAR less boxy and much to my surprise it is noticably **wider** than my OG Rift, I had heard mixed reports of this with some saying the field of view felt narrower, well I can confirm that this isn't the case and I can see more both horizontally and vertically, this is the first thing I noticed and I had tested this by standing on the balcony of my Home and looking out over the mountains (something I did a lot) and immediately it felt like I could both see more, and further - it's a noticable upgrade!   
   
Next were the **colours**, all colors seemed brighter with darker shades being far more uniform and 'black' than on my OG Rift, there were no tints or maura artefacts. Everything felt more alive, I can see any games based in space are going to be a real treat to play on this!   
   
Now onto **resolution**, I was expecting the edges to have that wierd pixelation effect you often see in screenshots from Quest games, I did not see any of this, I looked hard for compression artefacts and could find none (I spent a good hour trying to pick them out, I could not), the resolution is noticably higher than on the OG Rift most likely helped by the higher resolution panels inside the headset, while the screen-door effect is still present if you look for it, it is a big improvement over the OG Rift, I noticed I could see the photos I have imported onto my wall much clearer from further away and could pick out details easily.   

The **lenses** are a big improvement over the OG Rift, there is still some god-rays but they seem far less distracting and the sweet-spot is much bigger, I can look to the edges and still easily read text and pick out details, the lenses seem larger and set further back meaning that someone with glasses will have an easier time using this headset.  

**Tracking** definetly feels 'better', the blind spots are 'static' and relative to me, rather than having to 'guess' where they are due to the placement of the sensors. The controllers worked just fine while waving them around like a muppit and even moving them out of my sightline didn't seem to cause them to drop out.

Finally comfort, I used to find the OG rift not that comfortable after an hour of usage and would get ""Rift face"", I personally actually find the Quest to be more comfortable than the OG Rift here.

tl;dr: It's better in every way than the OG Rift with the added bonus of being able to take it with you and hop into VR on the go",1575492049.0,19,33,196792

I've never had the chance to try VR, all VR demo's are far away and I don't know anyone with it. I know there are some people on youtube with lower IPD's like VR Oasis and I've seen posts of people on reddit saying despite their low IPD they're fine, while others saying it's absolutely nauseating and there's no way to get used to it. 

What're all the things I can do to make sure I have the most comfortable experience possible? (Like the software IPD adjustment).

oculus,Is my PC good enough for VR?,"So I know there's different system requirements that certain games have, but I just wanted individual opinions based on your experiences, whether or not my PC would provide an enjoyable experience for me with most VR games. I'm about to get an Oculus Rift S, and these are my system specs:

* Ryzen 5 1600 oc to 3.9 Ghz
* PowerColor RedDevil RX 580 8GB
* 16GB DDR4-3200 RAM
* Gigabyte B450 DS3H mobo
* 1 TB HDD (no ssd :( )

Games that I'm looking into playing would be Skyrim VR; Hot dogs, horseshoes, &amp; hand grenades; Blade and Sorcery; and possibly Boneworks when it comes out. If I could work on it, what would be the best upgrades? I have about $300 budget to work with if need be, and fortunately I've got a microcenter near me with deals for ryzen processors. Such as:

* Ryzen 7 2700X for $160
* Ryzen 5 2600X for $120

oculus,Got a Rift S the other day...,"...after selling my CV1 a few months back.

oculus,Rift S impressions from a CV1/DK2 user’s perspective,"When the Rift S was announced I admit I was a bit meh about it. The resolution bump and longer cable looked nice, but losing OLED and the rather nice audio solution of the CV1 just didn’t seem worth it. But then of course Black Friday took £50 off the price and it seemed like the right time to dive in and see how it is.

First impressions out of the box were mixed. The headset itself definitely feels high quality. The materials used are very good, especially the plush cushion on the inside of the halo. It just seemed a bit bulky compared to the CV1 thanks to the halo. I expected it to be much heavier than it was when I lifted it out of the box. Likewise the new controllers are a big improvement in materials, they feel fantastic in your hand.

The setup experience was a bit of a pain for no reason I could see. The mandatory headset firmware upgrade seemed like it had stuck and spent a worrying amount of time just sitting there doing not very much. There definitely needs to be better feedback to the user while that’s going on. And then I got the dreaded sensors can’t track error. Unplugging and replugging the USB cable as suggested had no effect, but a quick reboot seemed to do the trick.

Popping the headset on for the first time I was hugely surprised at just how comfortable and easy to secure it is. There’s no pressure on your face at all, the weight seems perfectly evenly distributed by the halo. Once secured it doesn’t wiggle or move about.

&amp;nbsp;

As soon as the screens activated the improvements over the CV1 display were evident. I was hugely sceptical of the claims of vastly reduced/no screen door but it’s absolutely true. If anything it feels like a bigger leap than going from DK2 to CV1 did. I had to keep my head absolutely still and really hunt for signs of pixels. It’s a huge improvement because everything looks and feels far more solid and much less like you’re looking through a mesh at a screen. God rays are indeed hugely reduced or eliminated. I noticed some shimmer around white text on a black background on a Wolves in the Walls loading screen, but nothing anywhere else.

Text on the Oculus UI is crystal clear, and Virtual Desktop is a joy. The ‘sweet spot’ is definitely far bigger and you can really look around with your eyes to see stuff clearly without having to move your head to get things legible. Watching videos with the reduced screen door and better pixel density  is a far more enjoyable experience, whether in Virtual Desktop, Big Screen or 3D SBS/180 content.

Firing up Elite Dangerous and DCS it was clear that legibility of text and instruments is vastly better, Especially in DCS. The inky not-quite-black of space (I never messed with SPUD) is still there but it looks significantly smoother with less obvious blocky gradients. Colours are great, contrast is not noticeably any worse than CV1 and it all looks superb. I haven’t noticed any detriment to the step down to 80hz refresh rate.

&amp;nbsp;

Which was when I realised that the tracking was just working perfectly. I’d not really thought about it, but the inside-out tracking does indeed work as advertised. In the few hours I’ve spent in the headset I’ve had no issues at all, even in a poorly lit room with a flashing Christmas tree at the other end. If I hadn’t known better I’d not have been able to tell it apart from the CV1 tracking set up, except now I have more bits of my room I can use as I can go in part of the room that I couldn’t cover with sensors before.

&amp;nbsp;

So audio. This surprised me. It’s actually really nice not to have anything on your ears and the sound is really not bad. It’s not great, but it’s spacious and very natural, even if it does lack bass. Sadly I’ll rarely get to use it that way as my PC is in the living/dining room and even on CV1 I was always getting told to turn it down. And that’s where the headphone jack really shines, because I can finally fully isolate the outside world from my VR audio. What I haven’t settled on is which headphones are best to use. My ATH-M50x headset fits over the halo, just, but it all gets a bit painful if I want to just slip the headset off quickly. Some AKG in-ear buds worked much better in practical terms, but at the cost of losing the spacious nature of the sound. In the end I’m a bit torn on this and I’m not sure if I’d rather have the CV1 audio solution back or not.

&amp;nbsp;

The other big addition which I was a bit meh about initially was pass through. It just didn’t seem to offer that much practical value. Until I realised that it automatically activates if you put your head through the guardian boundary. And that is really cool. It is quite handy to be able to double-click the oculus button and activate to check where you are without having to try and squint through the reduced (but not eliminated) nose gap.

That Oculus button on the right remote though. That needs a rethink. I know I’ll get used to it but I must have accidentally hit it at least five or six times and it’s just a nuisance.

&amp;nbsp;

So how do I feel about it overall? I think it’s pretty great. The downsides aren’t nearly as down as they might seem on  paper, and the improvements in the screen and lenses over the CV1 are spectacular. Virtual worlds now feel far more solid and substantial, and the extra comfort of the halo design means I can spend much longer enjoying them. I may even have re-kindled my love of VR all over again, which I genuinely didn’t expect.",1575455760.0,48,43,196792

oculus,"""Headset Sensor Tracking"" stuck for my new Oculus Rift S, haven't heard back from Oculus support and hoping you guys have other ideas on how I can fix this problem so I don't have to return my headset","**""Headset Sensor Tracking""** is the problem spot I can't get past.

So I unboxed it Sunday and had some difficulty getting started. Oculus software installed just fine, so I started the setup. I thought I had to have everything plugged in before I got there, so after it wouldn't connect I disconnected, restarted and tried again. After quite some time, the setup finally got past ""Headset Sensor Tracking"" and I was able to hook up the touch controllers and play.

It wasn't perfect, but it worked for a few hours Sunday night. I did the tutorial with the robot in the trailer, played around in Home, then figured out how to play Elite Dangerous. I didn't know you could hold down the Oculus button to reset the look in front of you, so I messed around with redrawing the guardian boundary so I could sit in my desk chair and play with it in front of me (knowing about the buttons now makes that 20 minutes of futzing with the boundary funny). Played it for about 20 minutes before bed (it took me several hours to get it going) and stopped.

The next day, I couldn't get it to read. I've got [my logs through last night here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1K-tI-jjVi4OKT8785p1TV4Fc3mvdL8UQ/view?usp=sharing), and it looks like the USB port isn't reading the headset. So I tried a number of things:

* *Change Advanced Power Settings*: **Disabled** USB selective suspend setting
* *Device Manager &gt; USB Controllers &gt; R-Click* ‘**Rift S USB Hub**’ and unchecked  ‘Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power’
* *Tried every USB port:* I have tried plugging the USB into every port I have on the machine, including the 2.0 slots. Every time, I unplug the Display Port cable and plug it back in 10-20 seconds after plugging in the USB.
* *Tried plugging in minimal other cables*: I read that it may not draw enough power if other stuff is plugged in with it. Didn't work when it was only cable plugged in any of the 6 USB ports.
* *Tried reseating the headset cable*: it was plugged in strongly before, but I reseated the cable and made sure to be careful plugging it back in.
* *Updated Windows 10*: No change
* *Updated drivers for GPU, MoBo, CPU:* No change
* *Uninstalled and reinstalled Oculus software*: No change

I have tried some other things, but they aren't coming to mind right now as I sit at work. I did order [this PCIe card](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00B6ZCNGM/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) on Monday night, but that isn't going to arrive at my house until Friday. Judging by the log, I'm guessing it's got to be that the USB ports on my MoBo aren't getting enough power to the headset, but the *audio* works perfectly fine - I've left the headset plugged in after trying to connect, and then played some Final Fantasy XI only to hear the audio coming from the headset.

If anyone has any ideas, I'll include my PCPartPicker parts list to show all the stuff in it.

Pressing menu + Y takes way longer than it should to make the light blink. It tries for 30 seconds or so before saying ""unable to pair"". It then disconnects the headset via USB 3 cable (though the cable itself stays connected) and the controller flashes fast in an S.O.S. style for minutes afterward. The headset cannot find the controller afterwards.

I have attempted disconnecting all other USB devices, running the driver through the support tab (which fixed another issue I had), and reconnecting both cables as the controller pairs. I have double checked the batteries as well.

Some things to note: Yesterday the headset made a quiet hissing/coil whine noise, which has since stopped (I read that was normal until guardian was set up but I haven't gotten that far).

oculus,Brass Tactics and The Unspoken are freakin amazing!,"So, after 6 months absolutely loving my Quest, and drooling over the expansive library of PCVR games, I finally just got a pc to use with a Link. There have been a few games particularly that I’ve had my eye on which really helped push me over the edge on buying the PC.

Now, finally, after months of watching gameplay videos and reviews I finally have them (well almost all of them) and let me just say I am not disappointed!

Brass Tactics is just the most accessible, intuitive and downright fun game, such a refreshing change of pace from all the pew pew. Don’t get me wrong, I love a good shooter, but I like to have a diverse library that covers a bunch of different gaming moods, and this fills a massive hole in my VR experience. If you’re on the fence on this one then I strongly recommend you try the free “Arena” version. 

The Unspoken is similar, in that it offers something different from a lot of other games, and what it offers is an absolute blast! Admittedly, I’ve only just got it and played through about an hour of the story mode, so I can’t comment on AI opponents or multiplayer, but what I’ve played so far has made me grin from ear to ear. I can’t wait to unlock all the different character classes, skill up and head into battle. So much fun!

Next on my list is In Death and Arizona Sunshine, but I want to take my time with these two before I jump to the next ones.

oculus,Is PCVR worth the jump.,I had no experience with VR until 2 weeks ago I bought myself a oculus quest. I love it since buying I have not touched my PS4 pro or Xbox One X I have just played my quest. I only have 3 real gripes with my quest one is the graphics. Although they are not terrible I want the most visually stunning VR experience. However in order to get that I would need to invest in a valve index rift s or vice pro. My second complaint is a lot of the VR seem like 1-3 hour experiences and I come from playing 50 hour open world campaign style games. Lastly is the game library although it has options it’s limited compared to the options I would have on PC. I have been considering building a PC for a while and now I’m thinking this might be the time with VR. However my question is for anyone that has PCVR is it a groundbreaking experience coming from a quest? My only fear is I spend 4-6k in building a gaming PC monitors desk chair upgrading my VR system and it’s just only a slight or not a huge 1000s of dollar better upgrade. I understand value is subjective because we all make different money. I am fortunate enough where I can afford to upgrade and spend the 4-6k for everything but I only want to do it if it’s truly worth it. I understand so much of this is subjective but I would really appreciate if anyone has any experience that could compare or give any advice I really do appreciate it.,1575516860.0,1,31,196792

oculus,"Getting the best performance to visual compromise, No Man's Sky VR, simple guide","I wrote this as a comment in another thread but I thought people may like to see it, and I was playing some more today after tinkering a lot the other day with settings, and was feeling confident about my suggestion.

With the various patches to NMS VR, a lot of the ideas put forward in older guides soon after the VR release aren't as applicable. I don't have the technical knowledge to tell you what kinds of little things you can try to squeeze the most juice out of your computer when playing NMS VR, but I did do a bunch of experimenting and determined what graphical settings should be prioritised for the best aesthetic, immersive experience imHo.

This guide is only effective for computers above a certain threshhold of power. Mine is an RTX 2070.

The short of it: prioritise super sampling over in-game graphical setting improvements. To a point. 

The in-game settings I will provide are based off testing where I feel these settings provide the most impact for the least resources. Further increases don't create substantial aesthetic benefit, but further downgrades result in pretty big negative aesthetic result. The guide starts with these settings, no more, no less, follow them exactly (if your computer can't run these settings at regular 1x resolution then I would ignore this guide T_T):

**Texture Quality**: High

**Animation Quality**: Ultra (depends on your CPU, because this setting uses CPU only)

**Shadow Quality**: Enhanced

**Post Processing**: High

**Volumetric Effects**: Standard

**Terrain Tesselation**: Standard (off)

**Planet Quality**: Standard

**Base Qaulity**: ...I haven't spent time around bases yet, so I'm not sure. I have it set to High for now.

**Anisotropic Filtering**: 2

**Anti Aliasing**: Off/none

**GBAO**: Off

Okay, in-game settings done.

**Go to Steam VR settings. Check the box to disable ASW (in the ""Applications"" tab).**

**After that, also in the Applications tab, just adjust your Super sampling as high as you can without losing that solid framerate (you want your game staying in the green of that little live display of your refresh rate).** If you can go higher than 200%, I'd stop there and start bumping graphics settings again.

But damn, 200% is beautiful. I can't run it at 80fps with 2x on my setup, but I tried it for a bit just to see and it's gorgeous. The super sampling makes a much bigger difference in NMS than any of those graphical settings past what I listed, imo.

On my system if I want to achieve 80fps I have to stick closer to 100% resolution. :'( I'm in the process of deciding whether I'd rather run smooth at 80fps or keep the super sampling nice and high and suffer the consequences...

If your computer can't handle those baseline in-game graphic settings, I would lower the graphics settings before lowering resolution below 100%. Shit gets rough. A big part of No Man's Sky is that beauty, and at some point that gets lost amidst the noise when the resolution isn't high enough.

If you do reach 200% at a comfortable, stable fps, imo the first thing you would want to increase after that is Anisotropic filtering. Anywhere up to and including the max 16. before prioritising something else. This will get everything just a little crisper and more detailed from a distance, which again I feel is one of the more impactful aesthetic changes you can make in NMS VR. Turning on something like Terrain Tesselation or GBAO is nice, but rather than being an aesthetic improvement, I feel that it's more of an aesthetic DIFFERENCE. So unless you're REALLY attached to the look of one of those, you don't really lose anything turning them off, and I wouldn't prioritise them (they seem to take up a lot of resources I think).

Hope that helps some people enjoy it!",1575430399.0,45,21,196792

Or might be the whole geforce experience as whole.  


For some reason it doesn't influence Oculus home that much, but when you run a game, even natively like Space Pirate Trainer or Catan VR you can notice it.

I think it might be one of the root causes why people get sick in experiences that simply should not cause motion sickness.

oculus,Rift S review after 6 months,"I purchased my first VR headset (Rift S) this summer and it has mostly been a blast. I've introduced family members and friends to VR, which has probably been the best part of the experience for me. Watching them pop into First Steps/Contact and Beat Saber for the first time has probably been one of the best gaming experiences of my life. I've finally been able to bond over games with the people in my life who don't normally play games at all. My girlfriend and I have put in a ton of hours on Beat Saber, the game is great and the mod community makes it amazing. Normally I have no interest in rhythm games but this one has definitely been the exception. I've also had a bit of fun with the archery range in The Lab, Superhot VR, and the lightsaber dojo in Vader Immortal.

All those nice things said, I really wish I could get more out of my VR experience and play some more intense games. Sadly, every time I've tried I've ended up regretting it. I've attempted a number of others (mostly Lone Echo, Pavlov VR, Onward, Blade &amp; Sorcery). I've got plenty of others in my library to try as well since I purchased the summer sale game packs on both the Oculus store and on Steam.

What's preventing me from wanting to even try is motion sickness (or virtual reality sickness, which I suppose is more accurately the lack of motion, confusing the brain). I've tried a lot of advice mentioned here. Marijuana, ginger tea, frequent breaks, slowly working my way up and trying to build a resistance. I'm always done by my first break. I start feeling it as soon as I load into these games. My IPD is slightly above the recommendation for the Rift S (69) but I don't think that's too impactful. And it's not just me, everyone whom I've had test my headset while playing a game with movement/""moderate comfort"" level has reported the same feelings of dizziness and nausea. This really makes me wonder what people are talking about on the sub when they claim to have overcome these problems, or never had them to begin with. I've only extensively tested it on myself, but I've yet to meet anyone who doesn't experience nausea or claim it doesn't bother them.

Because of this, I've preferred to stick to my 2D world of gaming and declare my VR headset a $400 Beat Saber machine, and nifty toy for social gatherings. While I did really enjoy my short play sessions of other games in the moment, it's just not worth the horrible regret afterward.",1575447057.0,11,56,196792
